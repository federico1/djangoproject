<p class="BLOCK1">This Appendix provides non-mandatory guidelines to assist employers in complying with the requirements of subpart L of this part. An
employer may use these guidelines and tables as a starting point for designing scaffold systems. However, the guidelines do not provide all the
information necessary to build a complete system, and the employer is still responsible for designing and assembling these components in such a way
that the completed system will meet the requirements of 1926.451(a). Scaffold components which are not selected and loaded in accordance with this
Appendix, and components for which no specific guidelines or tables are given in this Appendix (e.g., joints, ties, components for wood pole scaffolds
more than 60 feet in height, components for heavy-duty horse scaffolds, components made with other materials, and components with other dimensions,
etc.) must be designed and constructed in accordance with the capacity requirements of 1926.451(a), and loaded in accordance with
1926.451(d)(1).</p>

<p class="BLOCK1">1. General Guidelines and Tables</p>
<p class="BLOCK1">(a) The following tables, and the tables in Part 2 -- Specific guidelines and tables, assume that all load-carrying timber members (except
planks) of the scaffold are a minimum of 1,500 lb-f/in(2) (stress grade) construction grade lumber. All dimensions are nominal sizes as provided in
the American Softwood Lumber Standards, dated January 1970, except that, where rough sizes are noted, only rough or undressed lumber of the size
specified will satisfy minimum requirements.</p>
<p class="BLOCK1">(b) Solid sawn wood used as scaffold planks shall be selected for such use following the grading rules established by a recognized lumber
grading association or by an independent lumber grading inspection agency. Such planks shall be identified by the grade stamp of such association or
agency. The association or agency and the grading rules under which the wood is graded shall be certified by the Board of Review, American Lumber
Standard Committee, as set forth in the American Softwood Lumber Standard of the U.S. Department of Commerce.</p>
<p class="BLOCK1">(i) Allowable spans shall be determined in compliance with the National Design Specification for Wood Construction published by the
National Forest Products Association; paragraph 5 of ANSI A10.8-1988 Scaffolding-Safety Requirements published by the American National Standards
Institute; or for 2 x 10 inch (nominal) or 2 x 9 inch (rough) solid sawn wood planks, as shown in the following table:</p>

<p class="BLOCK1">(ii) The maximum permissible span for 1 1/4 x 9-inch or wider wood plank of full thickness with a maximum intended load of 50 lb/ft.(2)
shall be 4 feet.</p>
<p class="BLOCK1">(c) Fabricated planks and platforms may be used in lieu of solid sawn wood planks. Maximum spans for such units shall be as recommended by
the manufacturer based on the maximum intended load being calculated as follows:</p>

                       |    uniformly over the entire span area.
Heavy-duty..............|  * 75 pounds per square foot applied
                       |    uniformly over the entire span area.
One-person..............|  * 250 pounds placed at the center of
                       |    the span (total 250 pounds).

<p class="BLOCK1">(p) "Two-point adjustable suspension scaffolds." (1) In addition to direct connections to buildings (except window cleaners' anchors)
acceptable ways to prevent scaffold sway include angulated roping and static lines. Angulated roping is a system of platform suspension in which the
upper wire rope sheaves or suspension points are closer to the plane of the building face than the corresponding attachment points on the platform,
thus causing the platform to press against the face of the building. Static lines are separate ropes secured at their top and bottom ends closer to
the plane of the building face than the outermost edge of the platform. By drawing the static line taut, the platform is drawn against the face of the
building.</p>
