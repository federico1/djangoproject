<p><b>Case Report from OSHA files</b> </p>

<ul>
  <li>A tubular, welded-frame scaffold, 31 feet high, was erected to paint a
33-foot high sign at the entrance of a new shopping mall. After the sign had
been partially painted, the scaffold was moved to allow concrete to be placed
around the sign. Several days later, a crew of seven workers was instructed to
replace the scaffold and finish painting the sign. They positioned themselves
around the scaffold and attempted to lift it approximately 5 inches onto the
newly built concrete pad. As they were lifting the scaffold, the top section
partially separated from the adjoining section, toppled over, and contacted a
power line. A 28-year old carpenter and a 31-year old laborer were electrocuted.
The other five workers were hospitalized with electrical burns.</li></ul>
