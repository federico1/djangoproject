        <b><a name="General Information">General Information</a></b>
        &nbsp;
        <p>
<b>Q: What is the new OSHA scaffold standard
for construction?</B>
        </p>
<P>A: On August 30, 1996, OSHA issued revised standards
for scaffolds. The revised standard, known as
&#034;Safety Standards for Scaffolds Used in the Construction
Industry,&#034; <B> </B>is found in <I><a href="../../OshStd_toc/OSHA_Std_toc_1926_SUBPART_L.html" >Title 29 Code of Federal
Regulations </a> </I><a href="../../OshStd_toc/OSHA_Std_toc_1926_SUBPART_L.html" >(CFR) Part 1926, Subpart
L</a>. The final rule
updates the existing construction scaffold standards in
Subpart L. The new standards set performance-based
criteria to protect employees from scaffold-related
hazards such as falls, failing objects, structural
instability, electrocution, or overloading.</P>
<P>The new final rule addresses training and various
types of scaffolds, as well as falling object protection,
ladders, weather conditions, aerial lifts, stilts, and
other matters that were not previously covered by the
OSHA scaffold standards. In addition, it allows
employers more flexibility when using protective
systems for workers on scaffolding. The language of
the rule has been simplified by eliminating duplicative
and outdated provisions, consolidating overlapping
requirements, and enhancing performance-based
criteria to allow employers more flexibility in
compliance while still protecting employees.</P>
 <p><b>Q: What is Subpart L and who does it cover?</b>
<P>A: <a href="../../OshStd_toc/OSHA_Std_toc_1926_SUBPART_L.html" > Subpart L</a> of 29 CFR 1926 applies to scaffolds and aerial lifts in the
construction industry. This standard includes provisions on scaffold capacity,
scaffold platform construction, use of scaffolds, fall protection, and falling
object protection. The standard also includes requirements applicable to
specific types of scaffolds and addresses erecting and dismantling scaffolds. </P>
<A NAME="scaffolding_faqs_8"></A>
 <p><b>Q: When did the standard become
effective? </b>
<P>A: November 29, 1996-90 days from the date of
publication of the final rule in the <I>Federal Register
</I>(<a href="../../FedReg_osha_data/FED19960830A.html" >FR:61(170)46026-4613 1, Friday, August 30,
1996</a>).
Information collection requirements (i.e., written
certification) become effective when the Office of
Management and Budget takes action in accordance
with the <I>Paperwork Reduction Act of </I>1995. Written
comments on the paperwork requirements for the final
rule had to be submitted on or before October 30, 1996




 &#151; 60 days after initial publication of the rule in
the <I>Federal Register.</I> </P>
 <p><b>Q: Why did OSHA issue new standards for
scaffolding? </b>
<P>A: The agency issued new standards to simplify and
update the previous standards in use since May 1971 (see <i><a href="../../FedReg_osha_data/FED19960830A.html" >Federal
Register</a></i>). OSHA developed the new standards with the
input of many industry representatives to better
protect the estimated 2.3 million construction workers
(about 65 percent of the construction industry
workforce) working on scaffolds regularly. The
agency estimates the new standards will prevent about
4,455 injuries and 47 deaths each year, saving employers
$90 million annually in lost-workday costs
resulting from scaffold-related injuries. </P>
 <p><b>Q: What do I need to know and how can I get
that information? </b>
<P>A: All employers and their employees using scaffolds
in the construction industry must be familiar with
these standards. A copy of the regulatory text appears
at the end of this publication. The electronic address
to view or download a copy as found on OSHA's
Website is <A HREF="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.osha.gov/  \n\nThis file is not located on this CD.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server (requires a current connection to the Internet)?'))window.location='http://www.osha.gov/'" >http://www.osha.gov/</A>. The regulatory text
also is found in <a href="../../OshStd_toc/OSHA_Std_toc_1926_SUBPART_L.html" > 29 CFR 1926, Subpart
L</a>, which is
available from the Government Printing Office at

869-034-00107-6; cost $30 (foreign $37.50). </P>
 <p><b>Q: Are there other standards that apply to
scaffolds? </b>
<P>A: 29 CFR contains other standards that apply to
construction work such as the responsibility to initiate
and maintain programs (<a href="../../OshStd_data/1926_0020.html#1926.20(b)(1)" >1926.20(b)(1)</a>); <B> </B>exposures to

 <p><b>Q: What are the highlights of the revised
scaffolding standard? </b>
<P>A: Employers and employees should be familiar
with seven key provisions of the revised scaffolding
standard: </P>
        <UL>
            <LI>The standard requires fall protection at a 10 foot
height above a lower level for employees. <a href="../../OshStd_data/1926_0451.html#1926.451(g)(1)" >1926.451(g)(1)</a></LI>
            <LI>Guardrail height &#151; The height of the toprail for
scaffolds manufactured and placed in service
before January 1, 2000 can be between 36
inches (0.9 m) and 45 inches (1.2 m). The
height of the toprail for scaffolds manufactured
and placed in service after January 1, 2000 must
be between 38 inches (0.97 m) and 45 inches
(1.2 m). <a href="../../OshStd_data/1926_0451.html#1926.451(g)(4)(ii)" >1926.451(g)(4)(ii)</a>

<p>When the crosspoint of crossbracing is used as a toprail, it must be between 38 inches (0.97 m)
and 48 inches (1.3 m) above the work platform. <a href="../../OshStd_data/1926_0451.html#1926.451(g)(4)(xv)" >1926.451(g)(4)(xv)</a></p>
              <P>Midrails must be installed approximately
halfway between the toprail and the platform
surface. <a href="../../OshStd_data/1926_0451.html#1926.451(g)(4)(iv)" >1926.451(g)(4)(iv)</a> When a crosspoint of crossbracing is
used as a midrail, it must be between 20 inches
(0.5 m) and 30 inches (0.8 m) above the work
platform. <a href="../../OshStd_data/1926_0451.html#1926.451(g)(4)(xv)" >1926.451(g)(4)(xv)</a></P></LI>
<li> Erecting and Dismantling &#151; When erecting and dismantling supported
scaffolds, a competent person must determine
the feasibility of providing a safe means of
access and fall protection for these operations. <a href="../../OshStd_data/1926_0451.html#1926.451(e)(9)" >1926.451(e)(9)</a> &amp;
  <a href="../../OshStd_data/1926_0451.html#1926.451(g)(2)" >1926.451(g)(2)</a></li>
<li>Training &#151; Employers must train each employee
who works on a scaffold on the procedures to control or minimize the hazards.<B> 
  </B> <a href="../../OshStd_data/1926_0454.html" > 1926.454</a> </li>

<li>Inspections &#151; Before each work shift and after
any occurrence that could affect the structural
integrity, a competent person must inspect the
scaffold and scaffold components for visible
defects.<B>  </B><a href="../../OshStd_data/1926_0451.html#1926.451(f)(3)" > 1926.451(f)(3)</a></li>
<li>Overhand bricklaying &#151; A guardrail or personal fall arrest system on all sides except the side
where the work is being done must protect employees doing overhand bricklaying from supported scaffolds.<a href="../../OshStd_data/1926_0451.html#1926.451(g)(1)(vi)" >1926.451(g)(1)(vi)</a><B>
</B>The standards for aerial lifts have been relocated from 1926.556 to <a href="../../OshStd_data/1926_0453.html" >1926.453</a>.</li>
            </ul>
<P><B>Q: When is a competent person required for
scaffolding?</B></P>
<P>A: OSHA's scaffolding standard defines a competent
person as &#034;one who is capable of identifying
existing and predictable hazards in the surroundings
or working conditions, which are unsanitary,
hazardous or dangerous to employees, and who has authorization
to take prompt corrective measures to eliminate
them.&#034; <a href="../../OshStd_data/1926_0450.html#1926.450(b)" >1926.450(b)</a> </P>

        <P>A: Fall protection includes guardrail systems and personal fall
                arrest systems. Guardrail systems are explained below in another
                question. Personal fall arrest system means a system used to
        arrest an employee in a fall from a working level. Personal fall arrest systems include harnesses,
                components of the harness/belt such as D-rings, and snap
                hooks, lifelines, and anchorage point.&nbsp;</P>
