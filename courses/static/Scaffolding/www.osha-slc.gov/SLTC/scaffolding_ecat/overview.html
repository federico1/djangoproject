        <P><B>Why Is Scaffold Safety Important</B>
        <P>When OSHA revised its Scaffolds standard in 1996, BLS studies showed
        that 25% of workers injured in scaffold accidents had received no scaffold safety training,
        and 77% of scaffolds were not equipped with guardrails.</FONT></P>

        <P>OSHA estimates that informed employers and workers, in compliance
        with correct safety standards, can save as many as 50 lives and prevent 4,500 accidents
        every year.</P>

        <p><B>What Is A Scaffold?</B>
        <P>A scaffold is defined as an elevated, temporary work platform. There are three basic
        types of scaffolds:</P>

        <UL>
            <LI>Supported scaffolds, which consist of one or more platforms supported by rigid, load
                bearing members, such as poles, legs, frames, outriggers, etc.</LI>
            <LI>Suspended scaffolds, which are one or more platforms suspended by ropes or other
                non-rigid, overhead support.</LI>
            <LI>Other scaffolds, principally manlifts, personnel hoists, etc., which are sometimes
                thought of as vehicles or machinery, but can be regarded as another type of
                supported scaffold.</LI>
        </UL>
        <P><B>Common Hazards Associated With All Scaffolds</B></P>

        <UL>
            <LI>Falls from elevation, due to lack of fall protection;</LI>
            <LI>Collapse of the scaffold, caused by instability or overloading;</LI>
            <LI>Being struck by falling tools, work materials, or debris; and</LI>
            <LI>Electrocution, principally due to proximity of the scaffold to overhead power lines.</LI>
        </UL>
        <P>(These hazards will be addressed within the two
          specific groups below.)</P>

        <P><B>Who Uses Scaffolds</B>
        </P>

        <P>Workers on scaffolds can be divided into two groups:
        </P>

          <ul>
            <li><a href="erectors_dismantlers/e_d.html" >Erectors/Dismantlers</a> &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            <li><a href="users/users.html" >Users</a>&nbsp;
            </li>
          </ul>
        <P>&nbsp;</P>
