Re: 29 CFR 1926.451(g)(3)(iv)</p>
<p>
This is in response to your letter dated July 22, 1998, in which you ask about OSHA 
requirements regarding multilevel suspended scaffolds.  As you know, you originally sent your 
letter to our Region X office in Seattle, WA., and they forwarded the letter to us.  In your 
letter, you ask questions that relate to the requirement in 29 CFR 1926.451 that lifelines, 
support lines and suspension ropes not be attached to a common anchor point.</p>
<p>
<b class="ITALICS">Primary and secondary support lines may not be attached to an outrigger by a 
common shackle</b><br>
First you ask if it is permissible to attach both the primary and the secondary support lines 
to a common shackle on one outrigger. In your example each line has separate tiebacks to 
separate anchor points on the building.   In your view it should be permissible to use a 
common shackle to attach both lines to the outrigger as long as the support lines would remain 
attached to their tiebacks if the common shackle were to fail.</p>
<p>
29 CFR 1926.451(g)(3)(iv) states that “vertical lifelines, independent support lines, and 
suspension ropes shall not be attached to each other, nor shall they be attached to or use the 
same point of anchorage, nor shall they be attached to the same point on the scaffold or 
personal fall arrest system.”  Since the outrigger is part of the scaffold, by connecting the 
primary and secondary lines to the outrigger with a common shackle you would be attaching 
those lines to a common point on the scaffold.   It is, however, acceptable to attach both the 
primary support line and the secondary support line to the same outrigger as long as they are 
attached at different points.  When using this arrangement, the secondary support line should 
be located at a point on the outrigger that will minimize the distance the scaffold will 
travel if the primary support line fails.  (See attached drawing).</p>
<p>
<b class="ITALICS">Use of hoists with built-in secondary ropes are permitted where secondary 
lines are not mandated</b><br>
In your next question you ask if the use of “engineered and tested components such as hoists 
with built-in secondary rope brakes, stirrups and davits” would allow the attachment of both 
the primary and secondary support lines to the same point on the scaffold.  When using a 
single level suspended scaffold, an engineered hoist that is manufactured to house both the 
primary and secondary support line may be used since a secondary support line is not 
required.  However,  employees working on the scaffold must still be protected with a personal 
fall arrest system.</p>
<p>
If a multi-level suspended scaffold is used, then this type of manufactured hoist does not 
comply with OSHA regulations. Under &#167;1926.452 (v)(1) these scaffolds are required to 
have additional, independent support lines. The type of hoist you describe attaches to the 
scaffold in such a way that both the primary and secondary support lines attach to a single 
point on the scaffold. Since these lines are ultimately attached to a common point on the 
scaffold, the lines are no longer independent and impermissibly attach to a common point.  If 
the hoist were to become detached from the scaffold, the secondary line would detach along 
with the primary line.</p>
<p>
If you require any further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact us again by writing 
to: USDOL-OSHA, DOC-Office of Construction Standards and Compliance Assistance, Room N3467, 
200 Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20210</p>
