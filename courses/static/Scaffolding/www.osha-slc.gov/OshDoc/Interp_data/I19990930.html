<p>September 30, 1999</p>

<p>Mr. Richard C. Avery<br>
President<br>
Safety Engineering Services<br>
2304 22nd Street North<br>
St. Petersburg, FL 33713</p>

<p>Subject: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1926.451(c)(2)(iv) and (v), 1926.451(f)(5), 
1926.451(f)(7), 1926.452(w)(4), 1926.602(c)(viii)(A) to (C), forklifts, 
powered industrial trucks</p>

<p>Dear Mr. Avery:</p>

<p>This responds to your April 15, 1998, letter to the Occupational Safety and 
Health Administration (OSHA), in which you ask several questions regarding 
the use of forklifts (powered industrial trucks) and rough-terrain forklifts 
(Lull, Pettibone, etc.) to elevate personnel.</p>

<p><b class="ITALICS">Question (1):</b>  If a powered industrial truck 
operator's manual specifically states that it is not to be used for 
elevating personnel platforms, may the truck nonetheless be used for that 
purpose? If so, which standards would govern such use?</p>

<p><b class="ITALICS">Answer:</b> OSHA's scaffold standard, &#167;1926.451(c)
(2)(iv), specifically requires that front-end loaders and "similar pieces of 
equipment" not be used to support scaffold platforms unless specifically 
designed by the manufacturer for such use. In the preamble to that standard, 
OSHA stated that:</p>

<p class="BLOCK1">OSHA notes that the commenters are in general agreement that all equipment 
not specifically designed to support scaffold platforms must not be used...</p>

<p><center>* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</center></p>

<p class="BLOCK1">All supported scaffolds, including those supported by forklifts, front-end 
loaders and similar pieces of equipment, must comply with the applicable 
requirements of &#167;1926.451 for ... use.</p>

<p>(This portion of the preamble is published in Volume 61 of the Federal 
Register on page 46,044).</p>

<p>Powered industrial trucks, which include forklifts, as well as rough terrain 
forklifts, are "similar pieces of equipment" to forklifts and front end 
loaders in this context.  Therefore, they fall within the requirements of 
&#167;1926.451(c)(2)(iv).</p>

<p>If the manufacturer's operator manual states that it is not to be used for 
elevating personnel platforms, use of the equipment to support such a 
platform would violate this provision. Consequently, OSHA prohibits the use 
of such equipment to elevate personnel.</p>

<p><b class="ITALICS">Question (2):</b> If the operator's manual is silent on 
whether the equipment may be used to elevate personnel, may an employer 
assume that it may be used for that purpose?</p>

<p><b class="ITALICS">Answer:</b> No. If the owner's manual for the equipment 
is silent in this regard, the employer must determine if the front end 
loader was designed for such purposes. The standard places the obligation on 
the employer to ensure that this type of equipment is used to elevate 
personnel only where the manufacturer has designed it to do so.  The 
employer would have to either find out from the manufacturer that it was 
designed for this use or (where that information is unavailable) obtain a 
certification by a certified professional engineer that the equipment was so 
designed.</p>

<p><b class="ITALICS">Question (3):</b> Is there a standard that requires 
employees to be able to shut off the truck's power when on platforms 
elevated by forklifts?</p>

<p><b class="ITALICS">Answer:</b> Yes.  The Material Handling Equipment 
standard, section 1926.602(c)(1)(vi), requires that the design of all 
industrial trucks used by an employer meet the requirements in the American 
National Standards Institute (ANSI) B56.1-1969, Safety Standards for Powered 
Industrial Trucks. ANSI B56.1, paragraph 416, requires “order picker truck
[s], high lift” to have travel and power controls at the platform level (see 
attached ANSI diagram of this type of truck).  Whenever a forklift is used 
to elevate a platform and is used in a manner that makes it the equivalent 
of a high lift order picker truck, the controls specified in this ANSI 
provision must be in place.</p>

<p><b class="ITALICS">Question (4):</b> You mention that the American Society 
of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) B56.6-1992, Safety Standard for Rough Terrain 
Forklift Trucks, contains provisions (section 5.15 and 8.25) for controls 
located at the elevated platform level. Under B56.6-1992, rough terrain 
forklift trucks may only be used as an elevated work platform if there are 
no other "practical options" available. You ask us to explain the kind of 
efforts an employer must make before concluding that there are no other 
practical options.</p>

<p><b class="ITALICS">Answer:</b>  Our standard incorporates the ANSI B56.1 - 
1969 standard, not the ASME B56.6-1992 standard that you reference. Before 
using a rough terrain forklift truck as a work platform, the employer would 
normally have to consider the feasibility of equipment such as scaffolds, 
scissor lifts, aerial lifts and ladders. Only after determining that 
alternatives such as these were infeasible would the use of the forklift be 
permitted.</p>

<p>The kinds of efforts required of a contractor to determine that there are no 
other practical options would be those necessary to make an informed 
judgment about whether equipment such as scaffolds, scissor lifts, aerial 
lifts and ladders could be used.</p>

<p><b class="ITALICS">Question (5):</b> How can an employer determine if an 
operator is qualified?</p>

<p><b class="ITALICS">Answer:</b> OSHA has recently issued a new rule (29 CFR 
&#167;1910.178(l) , which applies to construction through &#167;1926.602(d)) 
on training requirements for powered industrial truck operators.  This new 
rule, which took effect March 1, 1999, was published in Volume 63 of the 
Federal Register on page 66,238 (we have attached a copy to this letter).  
It is also available on OSHA’s Internet web page at http://www.osha.gov/.</p>

<p>One of the requirements of this new rule, &#167;1910.178(l)(1)(i), is that 
an employer must ensure that the operator “is competent to operate a powered 
industrial truck safely, as demonstrated by the successful completion of the 
training and evaluation specified in this [rule].”  One of the requirements 
in section 1910.178(l)(2)(ii) provides that there be an “evaluation of the 
operator’s performance in the workplace.”</p>

<p>In the required training program operators must receive training in 
specified topics.  All topics must be covered except those which the 
employer can demonstrate are not applicable to the safe operation of the 
truck in its workplace. The specified topics include:</p>

<p class="BLOCK1">(a) operating instructions, warning and precautions for the types of truck 
the operator will authorized to operate; (b) differences between the truck 
and automobile; (c) location of truck controls and instrumentation; (d) 
engine or motor operation; (e) steering and maneuvering; (f) visibility; (g) 
fork and attachment adaption, operation and use limitations; (h) vehicle 
capacity and stability; (i) vehicle inspection and maintenance that the 
operator will be required to perform; refueling and/ or recharging of 
batteries; (k) operating limitations; and (l) any other operating 
instructions listed in the operators manual.</p>

<p>Also, training must be provided in the following workplace-related training 
topics:</p>

<p class="BLOCK1">(a) surface conditions including ramps and other sloped surfaces that could 
affect stability; (b) compositions of loads to be carried and load 
stability; (c) load manipulation, stacking, and unstacking; (d) pedestrian 
traffic in areas of operation; (e) narrow aisles and other restricted or 
hazardous places of operation; (f) closed environments and other areas where 
insufficient ventilation or poor vehicle maintenance could cause a buildup 
of carbon monoxide or diesel exhaust; and (g) any other unique or 
potentially hazardous environmental conditions in the workplace that could 
affect safe operation.</p>

<p>If you require any further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact us 
again by writing to:  OSHA - Directorate of Construction, Office of 
Construction Standards and Compliance Assistance, Rm. N3468, 200 
Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20210.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>
