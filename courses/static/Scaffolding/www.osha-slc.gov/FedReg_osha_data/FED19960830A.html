<p><b>Safety Standards for Scaffolds Used in the Construction Industry</b></p>

<p><b>AGENCY:</b> Occupational Safety and Health Administration, U.S.
Department of Labor.</p>

<p><b>ACTION:</b> Final rule.</p>

<p><hr></p>

<p><b>SUMMARY:</b> The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)
hereby revises the construction industry safety standards which
regulate the design, construction, and use of scaffolds. The final
rule updates the existing scaffold standards and sets
performance-oriented criteria, where possible, to protect employees
from scaffold-related hazards such as falls, falling objects,
structural instability, electrocution and overloading.</p>

<p>In particular, the final rule has been updated to address types of
scaffolds--such as catenary scaffolds, step and trestle ladder
scaffolds, and multi-level suspended scaffolds--not covered by OSHA's
existing scaffold standards. In addition, the final rule allows
employers greater flexibility in the use of fall protection systems to
protect employees working on scaffolds and extends fall protection to
erectors and dismantlers of scaffolds to the extent feasible. Another
area that the final rule strengthens is training for workers using
scaffolds; the conditions under which such employees must be retrained
are also specified in the final rule. Finally, the language of the
rule has been simplified, duplicative and outdated provisions have
been eliminated, overlapping requirements have been consolidated, and
the performance orientation of the rule has been enhanced to allow
employers as much flexibility in compliance as is consistent with
employee protection.</p>

<p><b>DATES:</b> <b class="ITALICS">Effective dates</b>. This standard will become effective on
November 29, 1996, except for &#167; 1926.453(a)(2), which will not
become effective until an Office of Management and Budget (OMB)
Control number is received and displayed for this "collection of
information" in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995
(44 U.S.C. 3501 <b class="ITALICS">et seq.</b>). OSHA will publish a document in the Federal
Register announcing the effective date of &#167; 1926.453(a)(2).</p>

<p><b class="ITALICS">Incorporation by reference</b>. The incorporations by reference of
certain publications listed in this final rule are approved by the
Director of the Federal Register as of November 29, 1996.</p>

<p><b class="ITALICS">Compliance date:</b> Employers are required to comply with the
provisions of paragraphs (e)(9) and (g)(2) of &#167; 1926.451, which
address safe access and fall protection, respectively, for employees
erecting and dismantling supported scaffolds starting on September 2,
1997.</p>

<p><b class="ITALICS">Comments.</b> Written comments on the paperwork requirements of this
final rule must be submitted on or before October 29, 1996.</p>

<p><b>ADDRESSES:</b> In compliance with 28 U.S.C. 2112(a), the Agency
designates for receipt of petitions for review of the standard, the
Associate Solicitor for Occupational Safety and Health, Office of the
Solicitor, Room S-4004, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution

<p><b>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</b></p>

<p>I. Background</p>

<p>Congress amended the Contract Work Hours Standards Act (40 U.S.C.
327 et seq.) in 1969 by adding a new section 107 (40 U.S.C. 333) to
provide employees in the construction industry with a safer work
environment and to reduce the frequency and severity of construction
accidents and injuries. The amendment, commonly known as the
Construction Safety Act (CSA), significantly strengthened employee
protection by authorizing the promulgation of construction safety and
health standards for employees of the building trades and construction
industry working on federal and federally-financed or
federally-assisted construction projects. Accordingly, the Secretary
of Labor issued Safety and Health Regulations for Construction in 29
CFR part 1518 (36 FR 7340, April 17, 1971).</p>

<p>The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (the OSH Act) (29
U.S.C. 651 et seq.) authorized the Secretary of Labor to adopt
established federal standards issued under other statutes, including
the CSA, as occupational safety and health standards. Accordingly, the
Secretary of Labor adopted the Construction Standards, which had been
issued under the CSA, as OSHA standards (36 FR 10466, May 29, 1971).
The Safety and Health Regulations for Construction were subsequently
redesignated as 29 CFR part 1926 (36 FR 25232, December 30, 1971).
Standards addressing scaffolds, &#167;&#167; 1926.451 and 1926.452, were
adopted in subpart L of part 1926 as OSHA standards as part of this
process.</p>

<p>Various amendments were made to subpart L during the first two
years of the OSH Act. The amendments revised scaffold provisions that
addressed planking grades, wood pole scaffold construction, overhead
protection, bracket scaffold loading, and plank spans. Also,
substantive provisions concerning pump jack scaffolds, height of catch
platforms, and guardrails were added (37 FR 25712, December 2, 1972).</p>

<p>Based on concerns regarding the effectiveness of the existing
scaffold standards, OSHA began a complete review of subpart L in 1977.
The Agency consulted the Advisory Committee on Construction Safety and
Health (ACCSH) several times regarding draft revisions to subpart L.
The transcripts of these meetings are part of the public record for
this rulemaking (Ex. 3-4). OSHA addresses specific recommendations
from the ACCSH, as well as those submitted by other rulemaking
participants, in the Summary and Explanation section, below.</p>

<p>On November 25, 1986, OSHA issued a notice of proposed rulemaking
(NPRM) on scaffolds used in construction (51 FR 42680). The proposal
set a period, ending February 23, 1987, during which interested
parties could submit written comments or request a hearing. The Agency
twice granted requests for more time to submit comments and hearing
requests. OSHA first extended the comment and hearing request period
to June 1, 1987 (52 FR 5790, February 26, 1987) and then extended that
period to August 14, 1987 (52 FR 20616, June 2, 1987). OSHA received
602 comments on the proposal, along with several hearing requests.</p>

<p>On January 26, 1988, OSHA announced that it would convene an
informal public hearing on March 22, 1988 to elicit additional
information on specific issues related to scaffolds, fall protection
and stairways and ladders (53 FR 2048). The informal public hearing
was held on March 22-23, 1988, with Administrative Law Judge Joel
Williams presiding. At the close of the hearing, Judge Williams set a
period, ending May 9, 1988, for the submission of additional comments
and information. OSHA received 31 submissions, including testimony and
documentary evidence, in response to the hearing notice. On August 11,
1988, Judge Williams certified the rulemaking record, including the
hearing transcript and all written submissions to the docket, thereby
closing the record for this proceeding.</p>

<p>In 1988, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), an
organization which sets voluntary consensus standards, approved a
revision of ANSI A10.8-1977, <b class="ITALICS">Scaffolding,</b> updating its safety
requirements for the use of scaffolds in construction and demolition
operations. Section 6(b)(8) of the OSH Act requires that when an OSHA
standard differs substantially from an existing national consensus
standard, the Secretary must publish "a statement of the reasons why
the rule as adopted will better effectuate the purposes of the Act
than the national consensus standard." In compliance with that
requirement, OSHA has reviewed the requirements of this final rule
with reference to the corresponding provisions of ANSI A10.8-1988. The
Agency discusses the relationship between the provisions of subpart L
and corresponding provisions of ANSI A10.8-1988 in the <b class="ITALICS">Summary and
Explanation,</b> below.</p>

<p>On March 29, 1993, OSHA reopened the rulemaking record for subpart L
(58 FR 16509) to obtain additional comments and information regarding
fall protection and safe means of access for employees erecting and
dismantling scaffolds; the use of crossbraces in scaffold systems; and
the use of repair bracket scaffolds. The comment period was scheduled
to end on May 28, 1993. On May 26, 1993, the Agency extended the
comment period (58 FR 30131) to June 29, 1993, in response to a
request for additional time to submit comments. OSHA received 46
comments in response to the March 29 notice. Those comments are
discussed below in relation to the pertinent provisions of the final
rule.</p>

<p>On February 1, 1994, OSHA again reopened the rulemaking record (59
FR 4615) to obtain comments and information regarding scaffold
stairways; repair bracket scaffolds; tank builder scaffolds; a NIOSH
study of workplace fatalities; and scaffold-related material
incorporated from the proposed part 1910, subpart D rulemaking. The
comment period, which ended on March 18, 1994, elicited 46 comments.
Those comments are also discussed below in relation to the pertinent
provisions of the final rule.</p>

<p>A wide range of employers, businesses, labor unions, trade
associations, state governments, and other interested parties
contributed to the development of this record. OSHA appreciates these
efforts to help develop a rulemaking record that provides a sound
basis for the promulgation of revised subpart L.</p>

<p>Based on its review of existing subpart L, OSHA believes that
certain provisions in the existing standards are outdated, redundant,
or ambiguous. In addition, some types of scaffolds used in
construction (e.g., catenary scaffolds) are not clearly addressed by
the existing standards, and some provisions cover only certain types
of scaffolds when they should apply to all. The final rule eliminates
those unnecessary, outdated and redundant provisions (e.g., revised
subpart L states the requirement for guardrails once, rather than 19
separate times as in the existing standard).</p>

<p>OSHA is coordinating the revision of part 1926, subpart L, with the
ongoing rulemakings initiated to revise the General Industry (part
1910, subpart D) and Shipyard (part 1915, subpart N) scaffold
standards, so that those standards will be consistent, where
appropriate.</p>

<p>II. Hazards Involved</p>

<p>Scaffold-related incidents resulting in injuries and fatalities
continue to occur despite the fact that OSHA has had a scaffold
standard (existing subpart L) in place since 1971 (Exs. 1, 2, 3, 42,
43, 44 and 45). However, the Agency believes that compliance with the
standard being published today will be better than it has been in the
past because this standard has been simplified, brought up to date,
and strengthened to provide additional protection.</p>

<p>Although specific accident ratios cannot be projected for the
estimated 3.6 million construction workers currently covered by
subpart L, the Economic Analysis that accompanies this final rule
estimates that, of the 510,500 injuries and illnesses that occur in
the construction industry annually, 9,750 are related to scaffolds. In
addition, of the estimated 924 occupational fatalities occurring
annually, at least 79 are associated with work on scaffolds.</p>

<p>OSHA prepared the following statistical estimates (based on 4.5
million construction workers then covered by subpart L) to support the
1986 proposal for subpart L, based on a review of accident data
prepared by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) (Ex. 3-1). The
revised scaffold standards contain a number of provisions designed
specifically to address the findings of this analysis.</p>

<p>a. Seventy-two percent of the workers injured in scaffold accidents
covered by the BLS study attributed the accident either to the
planking or support giving way, or to the employee slipping, or being
struck by a falling object. Plank slippage was the most commonly cited
cause.</p>

<p>b. About 70 percent of the workers learned of the safety
requirements for installing work platforms, assembling scaffolds, and
inspecting scaffolds through on-the-job training. Approximately 25
percent had no training in these areas.</p>

<p>c. Only 33 percent of scaffolds were equipped with a guardrail.</p>

<p>The following are recent examples, from the OSHA Integrated
Management Information System (IMIS) data, of the types of accidents
that continue to injure and kill employees working on scaffolds.</p>

<UL>
<LI><p>In July, 1991, two employees were working on a pump jack scaffold
doing roofing work. The scaffold became overloaded and broke. The
employees fell 12 feet to the ground, resulting in one fatality and
one serious injury.</p></LI>

<LI><p>In August, 1992, two workers were erecting an aluminum pump jack
scaffold. As they were raising the second aluminum pole, the pole
apparently contacted an overhead power line. The pole being raised was
29 feet 10 inches long and the line was 28 feet 10 inches high. The
line was approximately 11 feet from the house. One employee died and
the other suffered severe burns and was hospitalized. The surviving
employee noted that he thought they had enough room to work around the
power lines, which were not de-energized or shielded.</p></LI>

<LI><p>In July, 1993, a foreman climbed up the frame of a 45 foot high
tubular welded frame scaffold to check on an employee who was
sandblasting inside a stack at a steam plant. The scaffold was not
equipped with guardrails and there was no access ladder. After talking
to the employee, the foreman either fell from the unguarded platform
or fell while climbing down the scaffold end frame, resulting in his
death. There were no witnesses to the fall.</p></LI>
</UL>

<p>Based on its analysis of the available data and its field experience
in enforcing construction standards, the Agency has determined that
employees using scaffolds are exposed to a significant risk of harm.
Specifically, scaffold related fatalities still account for
approximately 9&#37; of all fatalities in the construction workplace. In
addition, the above data indicate that the revised final standard
would have prevented many of these accidents more effectively than
compliance with the existing scaffold standards. Consequently, OSHA
finds that the revision of its scaffold standards for construction is
necessary to improve employee protection. OSHA has determined that, as
revised, the standard clearly states employers' duties and the
appropriate compliance measures.</p>

<p>For additional discussion of incidence rates, significance of risk,
and the protectiveness of the final rule, see Section IV, Summary of
the Final Economic Analysis.</p>

<p>III. Summary and Explanation of the Final Rule</p>

<p>The following discussion explains how the final rule corresponds to
or differs from the proposed scaffold standard and the existing
standard, and how the comments and testimony presented on each
provision influenced the drafting of the final rule. Except where
otherwise indicated, proposed provisions which did not elicit comment
have been promulgated as proposed, for reasons stated in the preamble
to the proposed rule which is hereby incorporated by reference (51 FR
42680).</p>

<p><b class="ITALICS">Subpart L--Scaffolds.</b> The title of subpart L of OSHA's Construction
standards has been changed from "Scaffolding" to "Scaffolds", as
proposed. The word "scaffold" is used in the title and throughout the
final rule in lieu of the longer word "scaffolding." This change does
not affect the scope of subpart L. OSHA did not receive any comments
concerning the title of the subpart.</p>

<p><b class="ITALICS">Section 1926.450 Scope, application and definitions applicable to
this subpart.</b> Paragraph (a) of &#167; 1926.450 states the scope and
application of subpart L. The final rule will apply to all scaffolds
used in construction, alteration, repair (including painting and
decorating), and demolition operations covered under 29 CFR part 1926,
except that crane or derrick suspended personnel platforms will
continue to be regulated under &#167; 1926.550(g). Language explicitly
excluding these platforms has been added to the final rule. The
relationship between &#167; 1926.550(g), which covers these platforms,
and subpart L is discussed further in relation to &#167; 1926.451(c)(2)
and NPRM Issue 3, below. In addition, aerial lifts are covered
exclusively in &#167; 1926.453, as noted in paragraph (a) of &#167; 1926.450.
Proposed paragraph (a) covered all scaffolds.</p>

<p>A commenter (Ex. 2-38) recommended that OSHA explicitly exempt
personnel platforms suspended by cranes or derricks from this final
rule. The commenter stated "[t]his would avoid confusion, both for the
Compliance Officer and the employer." As noted above, the Agency
recognizes the need for an exemption and has revised paragraph (a)
accordingly.</p>

<p>Another commenter (Ex. 2-18), representing the elevator industry,
suggested that OSHA revise the scope of proposed subpart L to exclude
"False cars used in elevator construction that are equipped with
independent safeties that operate on the guardrails * * *" The
commenter supported the suggestion as follows: "An elevator false car
operates on fixed guiderails * * * equipped with safeties that ride on
the guiderails * * * and are operated automatically by the slackening
of the hoisting rope. Past OSHRC (Occupational Safety and Health
Review Commission) decisions have recognized that a false car is a
unique tool and is not a scaffold." The commenter did not cite any
specific OSHRC decisions to support its assertion.</p>

<p>OSHA disagrees with this commenter on this point, because the
findings in two enforcement cases involving the Otis Elevator Company
(12 OSHRC 1470 and 12 OSHRC 1513 (1985)) clearly indicate that the
scaffold standards of subpart L cover false cars. In <b class="ITALICS">Otis Elevator
Company,</b> 12 OSHRC 1513 (1985), the final order stated:</p>

<p>The evidence in this case showed that the false cars were used as
elevated working space from which employees installed permanent
elevator rails. The ability to raise and lower the false cars by means
of cables from overhead supports does not remove false cars from the
applicability of the scaffold standard, and a false car is found to be
a scaffold within the meaning of 29 CFR 1926.452(b)(27).</p>

<p>The Agency notes that elevator false cars fit the definition of a
"scaffold" in final rule &#167; 1926.450(b) in that they are temporary
elevated work platforms used for supporting employees. Accordingly,
there are no apparent grounds for disputing that elevator false cars
are properly regulated under part 1926, subpart L. Therefore, OSHA
will continue to regulate temporary elevated work platforms, such as
false cars and go-devils used in elevator shaft construction, as
scaffolds.</p>

<p>The Scaffolding, Shoring and Forming Institute (SSFI) (Ex. 2-367)
recommended that OSHA include "Window cleaning" within the scope of
subpart L, because "[w]indow cleaning is a common activity that, for
the overwhelming majority of instances, uses transportable suspended
scaffolds." In addition, the Scaffold Industry Association (SIA) (Ex.
2-368) suggested that OSHA add "scheduled and unscheduled maintenance
(including but not limited to painting and decorating, tuck pointing,
sand blasting, water proofing and window cleaning)" to the scope of
subpart L, because maintenance is a type of work "regularly performed
on scaffolds addressed in this subpart and, therefore, should be
included in the scope."</p>

<p>Another commenter (Ex. 2-462) stated that expanding the scope of
subpart L to include maintenance would create confusion and "would
greatly reduce the safety standard already in place for Powered
platforms for exterior building maintenance" (29 CFR 1910.66).</p>

<p>The Agency is not expanding the scope to include building
maintenance because building maintenance (such as window cleaning) is
a general industry activity, addressed under the appropriate scaffold
and powered platform standards of 29 CFR part 1910.</p>

<p>OSHA received a general comment (Ex. 2-29) which noted that 1910.66
addressed powered platforms used for exterior building maintenance in
general industry and urged OSHA to ensure that the corresponding
regulatory language in the construction standard for scaffolds was
consistent. As discussed above, the Agency agrees, and is coordinating
its General Industry, Shipyard and Construction rulemaking activity so
that employers in those industries have consistent regulation, to the
extent that workplace conditions permit.</p>

<p>Paragraph (b) of &#167; 1926.450 lists and defines all major terms
used in subpart L. Proposed terms and definitions which elicited no
comments and which have been promulgated unchanged or with only minor
editorial revisions are not addressed below. Those terms include
"adjustable suspension scaffold", "boatswains' chair", "body belt",
"body harness", " brace", "cleat", "coupler", "crawling board",
"double pole scaffold", "exposed power lines", "fabricated decking and
planking", "float (ship) scaffold", "form scaffold", "hoist",
"interior hung scaffold", "ladder stand", "lean-to scaffold", "lower
level", "mobile scaffold", "multi-level suspension scaffold",
"multi-point adjustable scaffold", "open sides and edges", "overhand
bricklaying", "platform", "pole scaffold", "pump jack scaffolds",
"roof bracket scaffold", "runner", "self-contained adjustable
scaffold", "shore scaffold", "single-point adjustable suspension
scaffold", "single pole scaffold", "step platform and trestle ladder
scaffold", "stone setter multi-point adjustable suspension scaffold",
"supported scaffold", "suspension scaffold", "tube and coupler
scaffolds", "tubular welded frame scaffold", "two-point suspension
scaffold", "unstable objects", "vertical pickup", "walkway", and
"window jack scaffold".</p>

<p>As proposed, OSHA is revising its definitions for particular types
of scaffolds by specifying whether a particular type of scaffold is a
"supported" or a "suspension scaffold." OSHA believes that adding
this information will make it easier for employers to identify the
appropriate general requirements in final rule &#167; 1926.451.</p>

<p>In addition, the Agency has revised subpart L definitions by
deleting language that limits the use of a particular type of
scaffold. Such substantive limitations are more appropriately placed
in regulatory text. Accordingly, for example, OSHA has revised the
definition for "bricklayers' square scaffolds" (a scaffold composed of
framed wood squares which support a platform, limited to light and
medium duty) by deleting the words "limited to light and medium duty".
Similarly, OSHA has revised the definition for "coupler" to be "a
device for locking together the component tubes of a tube and coupler
scaffold", deleting language addressing the material used for the
coupler because such requirements are more properly located in
&#167;&#167; 1926.451 or 1926.452.</p>

<p>The following discussion covers the terms for which definitions are
being added or revised in this final rule and those proposed terms
which elicited comments.</p>

<p>"Bearer (Putlog)." This definition is the same as the definition
proposed except that the word "Putlog," an industry-used term, has
been added to the definition. A commenter (Ex. 2-29) suggested putlog
should be included in the proposed definition "to show a close or
synonymous relationship to the term `bearer' " and because "it is a
widely used and understood term." The Agency agrees with the commenter
and has revised the proposed definition accordingly.</p>

<p>"Bricklayers' Square Scaffold" is defined in existing &#167; 1926.452(b)
and the proposed definition is substantively unchanged in the final
rule. The definition deletes the existing &#167; 1926.452(b) requirements
that bricklayers' square scaffolds be constructed of "wood" and that
the platform capacity be limited to "light and medium duty." The
revised definition recognizes that bricklayers' square scaffolds can
be constructed of materials other than "wood" and that their capacity
is not limited to "light and medium duty" as long as they can meet the
capacity requirements set forth in final rule &#167; 1926.451(a)(1).</p>

<p>A commenter (Ex. 2-23) suggested that OSHA adopt the ANSI
A10.8-1977 definition for Bricklayers' Square Scaffold which specifies
the use of "wood" and the ability to sustain light to medium loads. As
stated above, OSHA believes it would be inappropriate to limit
technological advances that would provide for the use of other
materials with greater capacities. Therefore, the Agency has not made
the suggested revision.</p>

<p>"Carpenters' bracket scaffold." This term means a supported scaffold
consisting of a platform supported by brackets attached to building or
structural walls. The final rule is identical to the proposal. The SIA
(Ex. 2-368) suggested that because different trades (i.e., cement
finishers) use this type scaffold, the term be renamed "bracket
scaffold" exclusively. OSHA recognizes that this type of scaffold is
used by several trade groups. However, OSHA believes that it is widely
recognized in the construction industry that "carpenters' bracket
scaffolds" are not used only by carpenters. Therefore, the Agency is
not making the suggested revision.</p>

<p>"Catenary scaffold." This type of scaffold is not specifically
addressed in OSHA's existing rule but is covered in final rule
&#167; 1926.452(r). This term refers to a suspension scaffold consisting of a
platform supported by two essentially horizontal and parallel ropes
which are secured to structural members and may be supported by
vertical pickups. The proposed definition has been changed to replace
the language "fastened to" with "supported by" and a phrase has been
added explaining that horizontal ropes "may be supported by vertical
pickups."</p>

<p>One commenter (Ex. 2-23) suggested that OSHA insert the word "wire"
between the words "parallel" and "rope."</p>

<p>However, OSHA does not intend to restrict the type of material used
for suspension scaffold rope as long as it is "capable of supporting
without failure six times the maximum intended load" as set forth in
final rule &#167; 1926.451(a)(3).</p>

<p>Two commenters (Exs. 2-23 and 2-368) suggested OSHA replace the
words "fastened to" with "supported by" in this definition. OSHA
agrees that the suggested words more accurately describe the function
of the horizontal ropes with relation to the platform and is revising
the proposed definition accordingly.</p>

<p>In addition, the SIA (Ex. 2-368) suggested that OSHA add the phrase
"and may be supported by vertical pickups". OSHA agrees with the
commenter. Vertical pick-ups can act as supports for sagging
horizontal ropes. Also, because final rule &#167; 1926.452(r)(1) refers
to vertical pickups, OSHA believes that it is appropriate to include
this phrase in the definitions.</p>

<p>"Chimney hoist." This term is being added to recognize a specific
type of multi-point adjustable suspension scaffold used to gain access
to worksites inside chimneys.</p>

<p>"Competent person." This term is being added to the final rule as a
matter of convenience for users. The definition is identical to that
found in &#167; 1926.32.</p>

<p>"Continuous run scaffold (run scaffold)" means a two-point or
multi-point adjustable suspension scaffold constructed using a series
of interconnected braced scaffold members or supporting structures
erected to form a continuous scaffold. This term is being added to
recognize this type of system. The Agency notes that the key element
here is that the scaffold members must be interconnected so that the
erected scaffold acts as a single unit. This would preclude planking
across two independent scaffolds without joining them so the resulting
scaffold acts as one unit. This system allows erecting a lengthy
scaffold without requiring a continuous planked platform, as long as
the smaller platform is properly guarded.</p>

<p>"Deceleration device." This term means any mechanism, such as a rope
grab, rip stitch lanyard, specially-woven lanyard, tearing or
deforming lanyard, automatic self-retracting lifelines/lanyard, which
serves to dissipate a substantial amount of energy during a fall
arrest, or otherwise limits the energy imposed on an employee during
fall arrest. The proposed definition, which was effectively identical,
has been editorially revised for the sake of clarity.</p>

<p>Three commenters (Exs. 2-13, 2-368 and 2-516) suggested that rope
grabs and some self-retracting lifelines are not "deceleration
devices" but are actually fall arrest devices. OSHA notes, however,
that it is difficult to differentiate clearly between system
components, as suggested, because fall arrest (stopping) and energy
absorption (braking) are closely related. The Agency also observes
that the performance criteria for personal fall arrest equipment
address the entire system, not just "fall arresters" or "energy
absorbers". Accordingly, OSHA has not made the suggested change.</p>

<p>"Equivalent." This term is used in the final rule to allow
alternative means of complying with the standard. The definition
provides that the employer must be able to demonstrate that the
alternative means of compliance will provide an equal or greater
degree of safety than that attained by using the method or item
specified in the standard. The final definition is identical to the
proposed definition, except that minor editorial changes have been
made for the sake of clarity. The final rule definition is consistent
with the corresponding definitions in 1910.66 and in part 1926,
subparts M and X.</p>

<p>The SIA (Ex. 2-368) suggested that OSHA not require the employer to
"demonstrate whether or not the scaffold is of `equal or greater
degree of safety' because the employer is too many steps removed from
the manufacturer" and because requiring the employer to test for
equivalency would create a significant danger that failure would
occur. However, the proposed language reflects the Agency's
longstanding position that employers who choose to deviate from
criteria set in OSHA standards must be able to demonstrate that
employee protection has not been adversely affected. The employer has
the flexibility to establish equivalence by any effective means,
including information available from equipment suppliers and taking
into account the specific circumstances of the work to be done.</p>

<p>"Eye" or "eye splice" means a loop with or without a thimble at the
end of a wire rope. This term is being added to the final rule to
clarify the Agency's intent that this type of connection is an
acceptable way to connect wire ropes without significantly affecting
their strength or capacities. The term is used in final rule
&#167;&#167; 1926.451(d)(8) and (9).</p>

<p>"Fabricated frame scaffold" means a supported or suspended frame
scaffold consisting of platform(s) supported on fabricated end frames
with integral posts, horizontal bearers, and intermediate members.
This is the term for the type of scaffold presently identified as
"tubular welded frame scaffold." OSHA has determined that the current
term is too restrictive because the words "tubular" means round and
"welded" means that metal components are involved. The provisions of
final rule &#167; 1926.452(c), Fabricated frame scaffolds, are not
subject to such limitations. They address fabricated frames and
related scaffold components whether the component parts are square or
round, or made of metal, plastic, wood, or some other material. The
final rule definition is identical to that in the proposed rule.</p>

<p>Two commenters (Exs. 2-13 and 2-320) suggested using the existing
term "tubular welded frame" and one commenter (Ex. 2-23) suggested
using the term "Fabricated tubular frame (Tubular welded frame
scaffold)" instead of the proposed term. However, as explained above,
OSHA does not intend to restrict this term to "tubular" or "welded"
components.</p>

<p>"Failure." This term is used in performance-oriented paragraphs such
as &#167;&#167; 1926.451 (a)(1) and (a)(3), which address scaffold capacity.
Because the word might otherwise be interpreted to mean only breakage
or a physical separation of scaffold components, the final rule
definition clearly indicates that load refusal (the point where the
ultimate strength of a component is exceeded) is also considered to be
failure. This is the point where structural members lose their ability
to carry loads although they have not broken or separated. The term is
the same as the term defined in Subpart X of Part 1926, Ladders and
Stairways. The definition for "failure" in the final rule is the same
as proposed.</p>

<p>One commenter (Ex. 2-40) suggested that the term "ultimate strength"
was not clearly defined. Another commenter (Ex. 2-38) suggested
deleting the last sentence of the proposed definition (Load refusal is
the point where the ultimate strength is exceeded) to avoid confusion
between "ultimate strength" and "overloading without breaking." As
OSHA stated above, "ultimate strength" may be exceeded without
component parts breaking or separating. Therefore, the Agency believes
the suggested changes are unnecessary.</p>

<p>"Guardrail system." This term refers to perimeter protection
composed of vertical barriers which are erected to prevent employees
from falling. The final rule definition is essentially identical to
the proposed definition. This term replaces the definition of
"guardrail" in the existing rule, which appeared at &#167; 1926.452(b)(10).
The old definition was rail secured to uprights and erected along the
exposed sides and ends of platforms. OSHA believes that this
definition did not adequately reflect the manner in which toprails,
midrails and other intermediate members, and toeboards combine to
provide effective fall protection. The final rule definition of
guardrail clearly indicates that the entire system, including toprail,
midrail (or other intermediate protection), and uprights, is covered
when guardrails are addressed in final rule &#167; 1926.451(e). The
definition of guardrail system used in the proposed rule stated that a
guardrail system was "a vertical barrier erected to prevent employees
from falling from an open side or edge of a scaffold platform or
walkway". The proposed definition also distinguished between "Type I
guardrails", which were capable of providing fall protection without
the use of personal fall arrest systems, and "Type II guardrails",
which would need to be supplemented by personal fall arrest systems
(as explained below, OSHA has not maintained this distinction in the
final rule).</p>

<p>The SIA (Ex. 2-368) suggested replacing the word "prevent" with the
word "protect" in the proposed definition of "guardrail system".
According to standard dictionary meanings of both words, "prevent"
more accurately describes the function of the guardrail system, which
is to keep the employee from going past the perimeter of the scaffold
in the first place. Therefore, the Agency is not making the suggested
change.</p>

<p>Three commenters (Exs. 2-13, 2-53 and 2-370) recommended that OSHA
retain the guardrail rules in the existing scaffold standard and
eliminate the concept of "Type I" and "Type II" from the proposed
definition of guardrail systems. The commenters suggested that the old
rule's definition of guardrail protection would provide more fall
protection than the definition used in the proposed rule. For reasons
discussed further below, OSHA finds that the final rule's requirements
for guardrail systems, which are essentially identical to those in the
proposed rule, provide more protection than the requirements in the
existing rule. However, OSHA has deleted the discussion of "Type I"
and "Type II" guardrails from the final rule for the sake of clarity
and has added specific criteria for guardrails to final rule
&#167; 1926.451(g).</p>

<p>"Horse scaffold" means a supported scaffold consisting of a platform
supported by construction horses. Horse scaffolds made of metal are
sometimes known as trestle scaffolds. The proposed definition was
similar except that it did not include the term "trestle scaffold."
The SIA (Ex. 2-368) suggested revising the definition to specify that
horse scaffolds "may be constructed of wood, metal, or a combination
of both. The metal horses may be referred to as `trestle horses'."
Under OSHA's performance-oriented approach to subpart L, an employer
may use any construction materials (e.g., wood or metal) that enable
the scaffold to comply with the capacity requirement set forth in
&#167; 1926.451(a)(1). However, the Agency agrees that it would be useful to
indicate that some horse scaffolds constructed of metal are known as
trestle scaffolds. OSHA has revised the definition accordingly.</p>

<p>"Ladder jack scaffold." The final rule definition, which is
identical to that in the proposed rule, states that this type of
scaffold is a supported scaffold consisting of a platform supported by
brackets attached to ladders.</p>

<p>A commenter (Ex. 2-23) stated that the capacity of this type of
scaffold should be limited to "light duty" and that the words "light
duty" should be included in this definition. As discussed above, OSHA
believes it is inappropriate for definitions to include substantive
requirements. In any event, the Agency has determined that a ladder
jack scaffold which complies with the capacity criteria of
&#167; 1926.451(a)(1) and the other pertinent subpart L requirements will be
considered acceptable. Accordingly, OSHA has not made the suggested
change.</p>

<p>"Landing." This new term, which has been added to ensure that the
requirements of final rule &#167; 1926.451(e)(4) are clearly understood,
refers to a platform at the end of a flight of stairs.</p>

<p>"Large area scaffold" means a pole scaffold, tube and coupler
scaffold, systems scaffold, or fabricated frame scaffold erected over
substantially the entire work area, for example; A scaffold erected
over the entire floor area of a room. The Agency has added this term
and definition, along with final rule &#167; 1926.452(d), to provide a
reference point in the standard for this widely used type of scaffold.</p>

<p>"Lifeline" means a component consisting of a flexible line for
connection to an anchorage at one end to hang vertically (vertical
lifeline) or for connection to anchorages at both ends to stretch
horizontally (horizontal lifeline), and which serves as a means for
connecting other components of a personal fall arrest system to the
anchorage. A vertical lifeline is sometimes known as a dropline. A
horizontal lifeline is sometimes known as a trolley line. This
definition, which was not part of the proposed rule, has been added
for the sake of clarity. The definition in part 1926, subpart M, Fall
Protection, is consistent with the definition in final subpart L. The
proposed terms "dropline" and "trolley line", along with their
definitions, have been deleted as separate definitions and have been
incorporated into this final rule definition.</p>

<p>One commenter (Ex. 2-57) stated that a "trolley line" was a
"horizontal lifeline" and suggested that OSHA set "strength
requirements." While final rule subpart L does not set numerical load
requirements for "horizontal lifelines", criteria for such equipment
are provided in &#167; 1926.502(d), subpart M, as referenced by a note
to final rule &#167; 1926.451(g)(3).</p>

<p>"Masons' adjustable supported scaffold." OSHA proposed this term,
which was not defined in existing subpart L, so employers who used
"self-contained adjustable scaffolds" in masonry operations would have
a clear reference point in revised subpart L. The final rule is
identical to the proposed rule definition.</p>

<p>One commenter (Ex. 2-23) suggested replacing the parenthetical
reference to self contained adjustable scaffolds with the definition
for such scaffolds in ANSI A10.8-1977. However, to limit redundancy
and confusion, OSHA does not believe that this term should be defined
by the format suggested by the commenter.</p>

<p>"Masons' multi-point adjustable suspension scaffold." This term
replaces the term "Masons' adjustable multiple-point suspension
scaffold" in the existing standard. The term means a two-point or
multi-point adjustable suspension scaffold designed and used for
masonry operations. The final rule definition is the same as that
proposed.</p>

<p>One commenter (Ex. 2-23) suggested OSHA adopt the definition for
this term from ANSI A10.8-1977, which contains the language
"continuous platform." However, it is not OSHA's intent to limit this
type of scaffold to a single "continuous platform." All types of
multi-point suspension scaffolds covered by subpart L may consist of
more than one platform. Multi-point scaffolds are not limited by the
number of suspension wires, platforms, or the location of attachment
of the suspension wires to the platform or platforms (Example: A
multi-point scaffold may consist of one platform suspended by four
wires or it may consist of two platforms suspended by four wires).
Additionally the definition suggested by the commenter did not include
the words "masonry operations." OSHA is including the words "masonry
operations" in this definition so it applies specifically to such
scaffolds used in the masonry trade.</p>

<p>"Maximum intended load" means the total load of all persons,
equipment, tools, materials, transmitted loads, and other loads
reasonably anticipated to be applied to a scaffold or scaffold
component at any one time. This term replaces the existing terms
"maximum rated load" and "workload". The term addresses the types of
loads which are to be included when determining the maximum load. OSHA
has been concerned that the word "rated" in the existing term "maximum
rated load" does not clearly express how the safety factor of four
(existing rule paragraph 1926.451(a)(7)) or six (existing rule
paragraph 1926.451(a)(2)) is to be incorporated into the determination
of the maximum load. The final rule definition and final rule
&#167; 1926.451(a)(1) clearly indicate that the maximum intended load is
determined without regard to safety factors. Once the maximum intended
load is determined, the employer then applies the pertinent safety
factor to determine the requisite strength for the system in question.</p>

<p>The final rule definition is the same as in the proposed rule except
the word "employees" has been replaced with the word "persons". The
SIA (Ex. 2-368) suggested this change because "[p]ersons other than
employees might be on a scaffold thus overloading it." OSHA agrees
that the weight of all "persons" needs to be considered when
calculating the maximum intended load.</p>

<p>One commenter (Ex. 2-23) suggested that OSHA add the closely related
term "scaffold load rating" which includes definitions for the words
"heavy-duty loading," "medium-duty loading," "light-duty loading" and
"special loading." The Agency provides examples of appropriate
measures for "heavy-duty," "medium-duty" and "light-duty" scaffold in
non-mandatory Appendix A of final rule subpart L. Accordingly, the
Agency believes the appropriate information is available and no
further changes are necessary.</p>

<p>Two comments (Exs. 2-13 and 2-320) suggested replacing the proposed
term and definition of maximum intended load with the term "Maximum
Rated Load." The commenters suggested that the term "Maximum Rated
Load" takes into account safety factors established by the designer or
manufacturer.</p>

<p>OSHA agrees that the term "Maximum Rated Load" does include built-in
safety factors. As stated above, by not including the words "safety
factor" in this definition or replacing the proposed term with
"Maximum Rated Load," which implies built-in safety factors, OSHA
clearly indicates that the minimum safety factor of 4:1 as set forth
in final rule &#167; 1926.451(a)(1) applies. The Agency believes it is
appropriate to take into account the "expected" burden as well as the
burden a scaffold "can" support without failure.</p>

<p>"Needle beam scaffold" means a suspension scaffold supported by
needle beams. The final rule definition is the same as the proposed
definition. One commenter (Ex. 2-23) suggested that OSHA limit the use
of this type of scaffold to "light-duty". However, as discussed
earlier, the Agency does not intend to limit the capacity of a
scaffold as long as it meets the pertinent requirements of
&#167; 1926.451(a). OSHA has provided examples of measures that would enable
a scaffold to comply with these requirements in non-mandatory Appendix
A.</p>

<p>"Outrigger." This term means the structural member of a supported
scaffold used to increase the base width of a scaffold in order to
provide support and stability for the scaffold. The terms, "outrigger
beam" and "outrigger scaffold" are new definitions provided to explain
the difference between these three similar terms. The final rule
differs from the proposal, which defined outrigger as "the structural
member of a supported scaffold used to increase the base width of a
scaffold in order to provide greater stability for the scaffold." The
wording change was made in response to a comment from the SIA (Ex.
2-368), suggesting that OSHA replace the word "greater" with the words
"support and increased." OSHA agrees that the suggested wording more
accurately expresses the Agency's intent.</p>

<p>"Personal fall arrest system." This term, which replaces the
proposed term "body belt/harness system", refers to a system used to
arrest the fall of an employee from a working level. It consists of an
anchorage, connectors, and a body belt or body harness and may include
a lanyard, deceleration device, lifeline, or suitable combinations of
these. The final rules on fall protection (part 1926, subpart M) and
powered platforms (1910.66) also define "personal fall arrest
system" in this manner. The final rule definition is essentially the
same as that proposed for "body belt/harness systems", and the phrase
"personal fall arrest systems" appears in the final rule wherever the
phase "body belt/harness systems" was used in the proposed rule. A
commenter (Ex. 2-13) suggested that the definition be reworded to
indicate clearly that lifelines and deceleration devices are not
always included as a part of a body belt/harness system. OSHA agrees
and has clarified this point in the revised definition.</p>

<p>OSHA has deleted the proposed term "platform unit" and has
incorporated the proposed definition language into final rule
&#167; 1926.451(b)(1)(i), which addresses the construction of scaffold
platforms.</p>

<p>"Power operated hoists." This new term refers to hoists which are
powered by other than human energy. The final rule language differs
from the proposed language, which used the term "mechanically-powered
hoists". OSHA has revised the terms "mechanically powered" and
"manually powered" hoists to read "power operated hoists and manually
operated hoists", because the Agency has determined that the language
should be consistent with ANSI A10.8-1988, paragraph 6.</p>

<p>"Qualified." This term is being added to the final rule as a matter
of convenience for users. The definition is identical to that found in
&#167; 1926.32.</p>

<p>"Rated load." This new term addresses the maximum load that a hoist
is allowed to lift. The discussion of final rule &#167; 1926.451(a)(1),
below, addresses the use of this term.</p>

<p>"Repair bracket scaffold." This new term has been added to address
the type of scaffold addressed by final rule &#167; 1926.452(x). This
term is discussed below in conjunction with the discussion of that
paragraph.</p>

<p>"Scaffold." This term refers to a temporary elevated platform
(supported or suspended) and its supporting structure, including
points of anchorage, used for supporting employees or materials or
both. The definition also clearly indicates that crane or derrick
suspended personnel platforms are not scaffolds. The Agency has added
the phrase "including points of anchorage" to the definition of
scaffold in the final rule to indicate clearly that points of
anchorage are considered to be part of a scaffold.</p>

<p>"Stair tower (Scaffold stairway/tower)." This new term has been
added to describe the means of access addressed by final rule
&#167; 1926.451(e)(4). This term is addressed in relation to that provision
below.</p>

<p>"Stall load." This new term has been added to identify the maximum
load that a hoist can lift without stalling or shutting down. The use
of this term is discussed in relation to final rule &#167; 1926.451(a)(2),
below.</p>

<p>"Stilts" mean a pair of poles or similar supports with raised
footrests, used to permit walking above the ground or working surface.
This term and definition has been added to recognize this type of
scaffold, which is used by many trades in the construction industry to
allow employees to walk elevated above the ground or working surface.
Final rule paragraph &#167; 1926.452(y) addresses the safe use of this
type of scaffold both as a scaffold itself, and on other types of
scaffolds (large area scaffolds).</p>

<p>"System scaffold" means a scaffold consisting of posts with fixed
connection points that accept runners, bearers, and diagonals that can
be interconnected at predetermined levels. This new term has been
added to the final rule to recognize the existence and acceptance of
this type of scaffold. The definition is identical to the definition
for the same term found in ANSI A10.8-1988.</p>

<p>"Tank builders' scaffold" means a supported scaffold consisting of a
platform supported by brackets that are either directly attached to a
cylindrical tank or are attached to devices that are attached to such
a tank. In the February 1, 1994 notice of record reopening (59 FR
4618), OSHA suggested a definition of "tank builders' scaffold" for
consideration. That definition was very similar to the final rule
definition except that the reopening notice definition did not
specifically refer to cylindrical tanks and did specify that the
platform was welded to the steel plates of the tank.</p>

<p>The commenters (Exs. 43-19, 43-23, 43-33, 43-34, 43-35, 43-39,
43-40, 43-42, and 43-43) who responded to the proposed definition for
tank builders' scaffold stated:</p>

<p>A "tank" is not necessarily a cylinder. The scaffold is used on
structures that can be cylindrical, rectangular, conical, spherical,
spheroidal, or elliptical. Also, "tanks" are constructed of material
other than metal; e.g., fiberglass, wood, etc. Some tanks have
vertical walls that are so thin that a bracket could not be welded to
it; rather, the bracket would have to be bolted. We would further
comment that the bracket is often inserted into a device which is
welded to the steel plate. So we would suggest not referencing the
bracket being attached to the structure, but rather the bracket being
attached to a device that is affixed to the structure.</p>

<p>In addition, eleven commenters (Exs. 43-19, 43-21, 43-23, 43-27,
43-33, 43-34, 43-35, 43-39, 43-40, 43-42, and 43-43) stated that the
criteria of an April 4, 1975 variance (40 FR 15139), which addressed
tank builder scaffolds, would be adequately addressed by general
provisions of the final rule and the definition of "tank builders'
scaffold".</p>

<p>The 1975 variance order stated:</p>

<p>The applicants' business, which is part of the tank building
industry, involves the erection of relatively large steel plate
segments of circumferential rings. Due to the unique nature of the
construction involved, special procedures, including special
scaffolding, have been developed. For example, as opposed to more
conventional scaffolds, tank scaffolds must be highly portable and
have a relatively low density of occupancy by [workers]. These
scaffolds are raised up the shell of the tank as new rings of steel
are added and work is completed at the level below.</p>

<p>Most plate structures are fabricated from standard length plates * *
* each approximately 31.416 feet (9.42 m.) long, [with] brackets
[normally] welded to them while they are on the ground prior to being
placed into position on the tank wall. Scaffolding and guardrail
supports are then attached to these brackets. If the applicants were
to comply with [requirements] that [the maximum spacing for supports
be no more than 8 feet (2.4 m.) for guardrails or 10 feet (3.0 m.) for
planking], they assert it would be necessary to lay out each steel
plate into sections with the brackets located approximately 7.854 feet
(2.36 m.) apart. Instead, the applicants wish to lay out the plates
into three equal sections with brackets located approximately 10' 6"
(3.15 m.) apart.</p>

<p>* * * Because the contour of the steel plates of the tank face is
curved and the adjacent edge of the scaffold platform is straight,
there is an open space between them. As a result, applicants have
installed taut wire rope on the scaffold brackets that extends midway
between the innermost edge of the scaffold platform and the curved
plate structure of the tank face to serve as a safety line in lieu of
an inner guardrail assembly.</p>

<p>Since the information submitted to OSHA in relation to the variance
addressed scaffolds used on cylindrical steel tanks, the Agency is
applying the criteria of the variance only to structures that are
approximately cylindrical. The Agency believes that non-cylindrical
structures should be addressed on a case-by-case basis under the
general provisions of the final rule. OSHA notes that 9 of the 11
commenters (Exs. 43-19, 43-23, 43-33, 43-34, 43-35, 43-39, 43-40,
43-42, and 43-43) mentioned above also stated "[t]ank builders place
the scaffold inside of a cylinder, traditionally, to erect the tank."
However, the Agency believes that the requirements of the variance, as
modified in Appendix A of the final rule, can reasonably be applied to
cylindrical tanks that are constructed of materials other than steel.
The final rule definition for "tank builders' scaffold" has been
worded accordingly.</p>

<p>OSHA has not promulgated specific requirements for tank builders'
scaffolds in the final rule because the Agency believes that the
requirements for those scaffolds are adequately addressed in the
general provisions of the final rule. The Agency notes that it has
placed several provisions (some of which have been editorially
modified) of the variance in Appendix A for the benefit of employers
who use tank builders' scaffolds, and that the introductory text to
the Appendix clearly indicates that following the Appendix will be
considered to constitute compliance with the requirements of this
standard with regard to scaffolds used in the construction of
cylindrical tanks. However, employers choosing not to follow the
Appendix must still comply with the applicable requirements of
&#167; 1926.451, particularly paragraphs (a) and (f).</p>

<p>"Top plate bracket scaffold." This term is being added to the final
rule to recognize a type of scaffold which is similar to carpenters'
bracket scaffolds and form scaffolds. This type of scaffold consists
of a platform supported by brackets that hook over or are attached to
the top plate of a wall. Such scaffolds are used in residential
construction when employees are setting roof trusses.</p>

<p>OSHA has deleted the following terms, which are defined in the old
scaffold standard, from the definition section of the final rule,
because those terms are now defined in other subparts or because the
final rule no longer uses the terms in question: "heavy duty
scaffold," "light duty scaffold," "medium duty scaffold," "midrail,"
"toeboard," and "working load." In addition, the proposed definitions
for "drop lines", and "trolley line" have been deleted from this final
rule, since they have been incorporated into the definition of
"lifeline".</p>

<p>Under Issue L-12 in the preamble of the proposed rule, OSHA
solicited testimony and related information on a suggestion by the
ACCSH (Tr. 206, 6-9-87) that definitions for "ramp" and "runway" be
added to the standard. The ACCSH indicated that the added definitions
would facilitate clear understanding of the requirements in proposed
&#167; 1926.451(c)(4) (final rule &#167; 1926.451(e)(4)). As noted under the
discussion of the Issue, a member of the ACCSH recommended that the
Agency use the definition of ramp developed by the National Safety
Council.</p>

<p>The one comment (Ex. 2-593) OSHA received addressing the Issue
supported defining the two terms. The commenter did not provide any
suggested wording but indicated that the definitions should be "clear
and consistent with existing OSHA and ANSI definitions."</p>

<p>In the final rule, OSHA has replaced the proposed term "runway" with
the term "walkway", to indicate the Agency's regulatory intent
clearly. However, the Agency believes that "ramp" is a commonly
understood term and does not require a specific OSHA definition.
Accordingly, OSHA has not added a definition for "ramp" to the final
rule.</p>

<p><b class="ITALICS">Paragraph 1926.451(a) Capacity</b></p>

<p>Final rule paragraph (a) sets the minimum strength criteria for all
scaffold components and connections. The final rule sets scaffold
capacity requirements that are substantively the same as those in
existing subpart L, while eliminating ambiguities and apparent
inconsistencies. The introductory text of the proposed paragraph,
which stated that "the following requirements applied to all types of
scaffolds except as indicated:", has been deleted in the final rule
because the Agency has determined that it is too similar to the
introductory text of paragraph (a)(1) and, therefore, is unnecessary.</p>

<p>Paragraph (a)(1) requires that each scaffold and scaffold component
be capable of supporting, without failure, its own weight and at least
4 times the maximum intended load applied or transmitted to it.
Paragraphs (a)(2), (a)(3), (a)(4), (a)(5) and (g) of &#167; 1926.451
provide exceptions to this general rule, and are discussed below. This
provision is based on existing &#167; 1926.451(a)(7), which requires
that scaffolds and scaffold components "be capable of supporting
without failure at least four times the maximum intended load".</p>

<p>The final rule clearly provides that the 4 to 1 factor for a
component applies only to the load which is actually applied or
transmitted to that component, and not to the total load placed on the
scaffold. Existing &#167; 1926.451(a)(7), taken literally, could be read
to require that each separate scaffold component be able to support
four times the maximum intended load (MIL) of the entire scaffold. For
example, the existing provision could be interpreted to require that a
crossbrace on a supported scaffold be capable of supporting the same
load as a scaffold leg, that is, be sized to support four times the
entire MIL regardless of where the load is placed on the scaffold and
regardless of the fact that the function of a brace is to prevent sway
and not directly to support the MIL. Such an approach was not OSHA's
intent. The Agency intended that each component be adequate to meet
the 4 to 1 factor, but only for the portion of the MIL applied or
transmitted to that component. The MIL for each component depends on
the type and configuration of the scaffold system. Final rule
paragraph (a)(1), which is effectively identical to the corresponding
language in proposed paragraph (a)(1), clearly expresses the Agency's
intent. The proposed provision has been editorially revised and
reorganized for the sake of clarity. In particular, the exceptions to
proposed paragraph (a)(1), which provide different coverage for
suspension scaffolds, have been clearly delineated as separate
paragraphs (a)(2) through (a)(6) in the final rule.</p>

<p>Paragraph (a)(2) of the final rule requires that direct connections
to roofs and floors and counterweights used to balance adjustable
suspension scaffolds be capable of resisting at least 4 times the
tipping moment imposed by the scaffold operating at either the rated
load of the hoist or at 1.5 (minimum) times the tipping moment imposed
by the scaffold operating at the stall load of the hoist, whichever is
greater. Proposed paragraph (a)(2) simply required that direct
connections to roofs and floors, and counterweights used to support
suspension scaffolds, be capable of providing a resisting moment of at
least four times the tipping moment. The proposed provision was
intended to clarify that the safety factor of four to one also applies
to direct connections to floors and roofs and to counterweight
systems. These areas are as integral to the scaffold system as the
scaffold platform itself. OSHA has revised the proposed provision to
account for the need to base the factor of safety for adjustable
suspension scaffolds on the rated load of the hoist and the stall load
of the hoist.</p>

<p>Several commenters (Exs. 2-8, 2-28, 2-64, 2-367, and 2-516)
indicated that the factors of safety for adjustable suspension
scaffolds should be based on the rated load of the hoist. Four of
those commenters (Exs. 2-28, 2-64, 2-367 and 2-516) and the SIA (Ex.
2-368) recommended that the stall capacity of the hoist be considered
in the factors of safety.</p>

<p>One of these commenters (Ex. 2-28) stated that many suspended
scaffolds are rigged by inexperienced persons who do not realize that
if the scaffold catches on an obstruction, the maximum lifting power
(stall load) of the hoist can be developed and transmitted to the
counterweights and anchorages. This commenter suggested adding one of
the following requirements to proposed &#167; 1926.451(a)(2) as an
alternative to four times the tipping moment: (1) or 4,000 pounds,
whichever is greater; (2) or 150 &#37; of the maximum pulling power of the
hoist, whichever is greater; or 4 times the rated load of the hoist,
whichever is greater. The SIA (Ex. 2-368) recommended changing the
resisting moment of proposed &#167; 1926.451(a)(2) to "at least 1.5
times the stall capacity of the hoist or four times the maximum
intended load, whichever is greater."</p>

<p>Three commenters (Exs. 2-8, 2-28, and 2-516) indicated that
Underwriters Laboratories (U.L.) standard 1323 (Standard for Scaffold
Hoists) limits the maximum output of a scaffold hoist to 3 times the
rated working load of the hoist. One commenter (Ex. 2-64) recommended
that OSHA limit the stall load of a hoist to no more than three times
the rated load of the hoist. Another commenter (Ex. 2-8) stated that
if the safety factor for suspended scaffolds is not based upon the
highest rated working load of any component, normally the hoist,
failure can occur.</p>

<p>Two commenters (Exs. 2-8 and 2-516) presented examples of the
relationship between the stall load of a hoist and the rated load of
the same hoist. One commenter (Ex. 2-8) provided the following
example:</p>

<p>A typical hoist with a "rated working load" of 1000 lbs. can exert a
pulling force of 3000 lbs. if an obstruction is encountered such as a
window ledge or air conditioner while ascending. If one designs for a
maximum intended load of only 500 lbs. because of a short light
scaffold platform or a work cage and the counterweight or suspension
system is designed for 4:1 MIL then the ultimate load that the
suspension can support is 4 x 500 lbs. MIL or 2000 lbs. A 3000 lb.
hoist pull can cause failure or even wire rope failure if 6 x MIL is
used. No one intends to stall a hoist on an obstruction but it does
occur. Therefore, a suspended scaffold should be designed for safety
factors based upon MIL or rated working load of the hoist whichever is
greater.</p>

<p>OSHA agrees that the safety factors for the counterweights,
riggings, direct connections to roofs and floors, and suspension ropes
of adjustable suspension scaffolds should be related to the rated load
of the hoist and the stall load of the hoist, and not be based on the
maximum intended load. OSHA agrees with the commenters who stated that
failure can result if the factors of safety are based on the maximum
intended load. Furthermore, the Agency also agrees with the commenters
(Exs. 2-28 and 2-368) who indicated that these factors of safety
should be based on 1.5 times the stall load of the hoist.</p>

<p>The Agency notes that the stall load of a hoist is equal to three
times the rated load of that hoist. When one applies the 4 to 1 safety
factor required (4 x rated load = 4/3 x stall load) the result
would be 1.33 times the stall load. However, while using 1.33 times
the stall load would provide the required safety factor, OSHA is using
1.5 times the stall load based on the above comments. The Agency
believes that such a requirement reduces the possibility of failure
due to improperly installed equipment as well as the dynamic loads
that can be developed when an obstruction is encountered. Accordingly,
the Agency has changed the final rule language so that it requires a
factor of safety of four times the maximum rated load of the hoist or
1.5 times the stall load of the hoist, whichever is greater.</p>

<p>Paragraph (a)(3) of the final rule provides that "[e]ach suspension
rope, including its connecting hardware, used on non-adjustable
suspension scaffolds shall be capable of supporting, without failure,
at least 6 times the maximum intended load applied or transmitted to
that rope." This is the same requirement as the proposed rule except
that final rule paragraph (a)(3) applies only to non-adjustable
suspension scaffolds, while the requirements for adjustable suspension
scaffolds have been placed in final rule paragraph (a)(4), below. The
proposed rule did not distinguish between these two types of
scaffolds. Proposed paragraph (a)(4)(i) has been redesignated to
&#167; 1926.451(f)(11) of the final rule, to consolidate all requirements for
wire rope used with suspension scaffolds. In addition, proposed
paragraphs (a)(4)(ii) and (iii) have been moved to non-mandatory
Appendix A, so that examples of measures that would comply with final
paragraph (a) are consolidated in one place.</p>

<p>Paragraph (a)(4) of the final rule provides that "[e]ach suspension
rope, including connecting hardware, used on adjustable suspension
scaffolds shall be capable of supporting, without failure, at least 6
times the maximum intended load applied or transmitted to that rope
with the scaffold operating at either (a) The rated load of the hoist,
or (b) 2 (minimum) times the stall load of the hoist, whichever is
greater".</p>

<p>This provision addresses adjustable suspended scaffolds and is
similar to proposed paragraph (a)(3) except that the proposed
paragraph contained the language "maximum intended load applied or
transmitted to the rope" instead of "rated load of the hoist (or at
least 2 times the stall load of the hoist, whichever is greater)". The
proposed rule was based on existing &#167; 1926.451(a)(19).</p>

<p>Three commenters (Exs. 2-8, 2-64, and 2-516) recommended that OSHA
use "rated capacity of the hoist" instead of "maximum intended load."
This recommendation was based on the belief that the safety factor for
adjustable suspended scaffolds should be based on the highest rated
work load of any component, normally the hoist. The Agency agrees and
has modified the proposed rule accordingly. In addition, the Agency
has included language that accounts for the stall load of the hoist in
the factor of safety for the same reasons that were discussed in
regard to final rule &#167; 1926.451(a)(2), except that the factor to be
applied to the stall load has been increased from 1.5 to 2 in order to
account for the 6:1 factor of safety applied to suspension ropes. This
factor of safety does not include an added margin as does the factor
of safety in paragraph (a)(2). One commenter (Ex. 2-516) recommended
an 8:1 factor of safety for suspension ropes on adjustable suspension
scaffolds. This recommendation was based on several factors that can
reduce the effective strength of a rope: (1) A termination rating of
80&#37; of the wire rope design strength; (2) time-use of the rope; (3)
energy applied to the system when the overspeed brake is actuated; and
(4) failure of the brake to set or the loss of one end of the platform
rigging. The commenter concluded that these factors can reduce the
factor of safety from 6:1 to 1.15:1, with failure occurring if
anything else goes wrong such as the free end of the platform swinging
through its arc.</p>

<p>OSHA notes that this commenter addresses a worst case scenario which
would involve violations of other provisions of the final rule. The
Agency believes that each of the elements of the scenario will be
prevented by compliance with the final rule. For example, final rule
&#167; 1926.451(d)(6) requires winding drum hoists to contain not less
than four wraps of the suspension rope at the lowest point of scaffold
travel, thereby reducing the force applied to the termination at the
winding drum. In addition, final rule &#167; 1926.451(d)(12)(v)
prohibits the use of U-bolt clips at the point of suspension for any
scaffold hoist. Also, final rule &#167; 1926.451(a)(3) requires that
suspension rope connections be considered part of the rope and that
they be taken into account when determining whether a rope is capable
of withstanding without failure at least six times the loads imposed
upon it.</p>

<p>Further, final rule &#167; 1926.451(d)(10) requires that a competent
person inspect suspension ropes prior to each workshift or after any
occurrence which could affect a rope's structural integrity. Paragraph
&#167; 1926.451(d)(10) also requires that defective or damaged ropes be
removed from service. For these reasons, OSHA believes that the final
rule adequately addresses the commenter's concerns.</p>

<p>The third commenter (Ex. 2-29) recommended that OSHA include the
weight of the scaffold and all its components in calculating maximum
intended load. The Agency believes the above described changes made to
proposed paragraph (a) resolve the concerns raised by this comment.</p>

<p>Paragraph (a)(5) of the final rule, which was not part of the
proposed rule, requires that the stall load of any scaffold hoist not
exceed 3 times its rated load. OSHA finds that this requirement is
reasonably necessary to prevent accidental overloading of suspension
scaffold support systems. OSHA notes that U.L. standard 1323 limits
the output force of a scaffold hoist to three times the rated load of
the hoist. As far as OSHA has been able to determine, the other
laboratories which test and list scaffold hoists adhere to the
requirements of U.L. 1323.</p>

<p>A commenter (Ex. 2-64) recommended that OSHA limit the stall load of
scaffold hoists to three times the rated load of the hoist. The Agency
agrees that it is appropriate to add the suggested provision, for the
reasons described above.</p>

<p>Final rule paragraph (a)(6) requires that scaffolds be designed by a
qualified person and constructed and loaded in accordance with that
design. The provision also indicates that non-mandatory Appendix A
provides examples of criteria, including design specifications, that
will enable the employer to comply with paragraph (a) of this section.
Proposed paragraph (a)(1), which focused on supported scaffolds, also
referenced Appendix A for acceptable criteria.</p>

<p>Non-mandatory Appendix A provides examples of design and
construction measures that employers can use to comply with final rule
&#167; 1926.451(a). This Appendix is based on the requirements set by
existing &#167; 1926.451(c)(1)-(4) and by Tables L-3 through L-19. OSHA
has recognized that employers can design and construct scaffolds which
satisfy the performance requirements of the final rule without
following the specifications set by the existing rule, and drafted
both the proposed and final rule &#167; 1926.451(a) accordingly. The Agency
believes that the above-cited specifications could assist an employer
in complying with the capacity requirements of the final rule, so OSHA
has relocated that language to non-mandatory Appendix A.</p>

<p>In Issue 5 of the preamble to the NPRM, OSHA requested comment on
whether or not all scaffold units (such as planks and decks) should
have their capabilities or grades marked on them. Some commenters
(Exs. 2-41, 2-46, 2-51, 2-54, 2-73, 2-367, 2-495, 2-512, 2-516, and
2-534) indicated they favored the requirements for such markings. Two
commenters (Exs. 2-495 and 2-534) stated "very few people would know
which grade for any species of wood qualifies that plank as scaffold
grade." Those commenters recognized that there was a lack of consensus
concerning the maximum safe loads on certain plank spans, stating that
"[a]t the same time, we believe it may be premature to require that
all planks be so marked since agreement on methodology of determining
load displacement has not been reached by the engineering profession."</p>

<p>Another commenter (Ex. 2-54) indicated that marks would not wear off
platform units because "[i]n most instances, planks are placed and not
moved [and are] generally not rubbed against each other constantly."
Another commenter (Ex. 2-516) stated "[i]f it is so worn that the mark
is lost, it probably needs retesting anyway."</p>

<p>One commenter (Ex. 2-51) stated that while grade marks would wear
off, it seems unlikely "that every plank on an entire job would
simultaneously suffer such a fate. We believe that invariably, there
would be some plank where grade stamping was legible if grade stamping
ever existed."</p>

<p>Another commenter (Ex. 2-41) stated "[k]nowledge of the capacity of
each [piece of] equipment is basic to implementation of this
proposal."</p>

<p>In addition, the SSFI (Ex. 2-367) pointed out that fabricated plank
stages and platforms are currently marked as to their capacity. They
stated that this "practice should be continued for fabricated planks,
stages, and platforms, as these are designed for unique applications."
The commenter also stated "there is no common practice within the
industry to have solid sawn lumber marked as to their load capacity."
The SSFI recommended "that the solid sawn lumber or laminated veneer
be repeatedly and continuously grade[-]stamped along the side edge of
the material at the time the plank is initially purchased."</p>

<p>Another commenter (Ex. 2-51) stated that "[s]ince 1980, Timber
Products Inspection has been involved in five cases where plank
failure has resulted in injury and litigation. In all five cases the
planks that failed were purchased as rough Canadian Spruce #1 and
better or #2 and better. None of the planks were grade-stamped and one
plank was identified as Lodge pole pine instead of spruce."</p>

<p>Another commenter (Ex. 2-35) recommended that OSHA adopt the
language of the ANSI A10.8 draft scaffold standard that requires
"solid sawn scaffold plank to bear the grade stamp of a grading agency
approved by the American Lumber Standards Committee." The commenter
also stated "it is essential to assure use of scaffold members of
adequate strength and stiffness."</p>

<p>In addition, a commenter (Ex. 2-534) stated:</p>

<p>We are strong advocates of requiring that all plank to be used as
scaffold plank be required to be stamped or embossed as "SCAFFOLD
PLANK". To most people, all planks look alike. Very few people would
know which grade for any species of wood qualifies that plank as
scaffold grade unless the grade stamp is explicit for flatwise use as
"Scaffold Plank".</p>

<p>* * * There is everything to gain, and nothing to lose, by requiring
marks that communicate to answer the bottom line question, "Is this
plank OK as a scaffold plank?"</p>

<p>In addressing Issue 5, the ACCSH recommended (Tr. 6/9/87, pp. 64-65)
that all planking and decks, etc., be properly marked as scaffold
materials. The Advisory Committee indicated that a performance
standard, which would allow employers to determine how they wanted to
mark these materials, would be appropriate. Among the options
envisioned by the ACCSH to distinguish the materials intended solely
for scaffold system use were color-coding systems, stamping, and
tagging.</p>

<p>On the other hand, some commenters expressed the view that a marking
requirement would be impractical (Exs. 2-15, 2-20, 2-22, 2-368, and
2-390). In addition, commenters (Exs. 2-20, 2-53, 2-55, and 2-390)
stated that the requisite costs would be burdensome, and others (Exs.
2-13, 2-15, 2-69, and 2-368) stated that, while manufactured or
fabricated planks or platforms were often or usually marked, carrying
this over to wooden components was inadvisable, citing anticipated
problems with the volume of planks to be marked and the marks wearing
off. Several commenters (Exs. 2-20, 2-55, 2-70, and 2-390) pointed out
the marks would lend a possibly false sense of security or safety, and
some (Exs. 2-20, 2-55, 2-69, and 2-390) added that maintaining the
marks would be neither feasible nor economical. One commenter (Ex.
2-70) stated "The user of platform units can calculate the maximum
load that can be placed on a scaffold and it is up to management
personnel to ensure that the scaffolding is not overloaded. I feel
that the marking of platform units does not, in itself, insure a safe
scaffolding."</p>

<p>After careful evaluation of the above comments, the Agency has
decided not to require marking of platform units. OSHA has determined
that, while markings can increase confidence in and use of appropriate
platform units, they do not add to the inherent safety of the
scaffold. Furthermore, the absence of markings does not establish a
lack of quality.</p>

<p>In addition, materials quality is only one of several factors which
must be considered when erecting a scaffold platform. Other
significant elements include unit size, span, and load applied. A
platform unit, whether wood or metal, solid sawn or prefabricated,
which is marked as appropriate for use as a plank, may be appropriate
for use in one set of conditions but not in another (i.e., longer span
or higher load). Similarly, a platform unit which does not have the
quality characteristics to allow its use in one situation may be
acceptable for use in another (i.e., shorter span or lighter load)
whether or not it is marked. The important consideration in all
situations is that the platform be capable of supporting the load with
a design factor of four.</p>

<p>OSHA believes the grading rules of recognized independent inspection
agencies, such as the American Lumber Standards Committee (ALSC),
provide useful information about wood plank selection and use. Planks
that are marked and used in accordance with pertinent grading rules of
the ALSC or other recognized independent inspection agency will be
deemed to meet the four-to-one requirement. Therefore, given the
extent to which the private sector has voluntarily adopted plank
grading and marking programs, the Agency has concluded that any
benefit resulting from the addition of marking requirements would be
minimal.</p>

<p>Wood products such as Canadian spruce, which are alleged to be
unacceptably inferior in some applications, could have standards
developed for their use by a recognized grading agency. OSHA believes
there are combinations of thickness, quality, span, loads, and other
factors that can be established for all species of wood used for
platforms.</p>

<p>Issue 17 of the preamble to the NPRM asked whether the Agency should
specify a minimum slippage capacity of 4,000 pounds and a minimum
breakage capacity of 16,000 pounds for couplers used on tube and
coupler type scaffolds. The SSFI and SIA (Exs. 2-367 and 2-368)
opposed such a requirement, stating that "the entire scaffold
structure should be required to withstand the specified design loads."
They also noted that this special component requirement was unlike
other OSHA requirements. The SIA (Ex. 2-368) also stated:</p>

<p>It is redundant and unnecessary to specify a quantitative value for
clamp strength since the required safety factors already in existence
provide the proper strength for the intended load. There may be cases
where the clamps should be of higher value or lower value, depending
on usage. Consequently, requiring a numerical value may produce the
catastrophe which the proposed rule is trying to avoid in the first
place. Existing rules require design by competent individuals, which
provides the proper safeguards against abuse and eliminates the need
for the proposed rule.</p>

<p>Also, a commenter (Ex. 2-15) indicated that a British standard (BS
1129) recognizing 2800 lb. has been in place for 20 years "with
satisfactory results." The commenter stated that most American clamps
are built to BS1129, and went on to indicate that the same 2800 lb.
figure is generally sufficient, except for possible heavy-duty
applications in a specific configuration. The commenter further felt
that specifying a 4,000 lb. minimum slippage capacity would "outlaw"
many clamps.</p>

<p>One commenter (Ex. 2-22) stated that both slippage and minimum
breakage capacities "should be equivalent to that required on the
other parts of the scaffold."</p>

<p>Another commenter (Ex. 2-128) stated "couplers for tube and clamp
[scaffolds] should be rated by the manufacturer in accordance with a
recognized testing standard [and] certified by an engineer." In
addition, a commenter (Ex. 2-13) expounded on the relationship between
the torque applied to tighten a coupler and the slippage capacity, and
noted that proper torque values needed to be determined by tests or
calculations.</p>

<p>The ACCSH (Tr. 6/9/87, pp. 138-147) recommended that OSHA specify
both minimum slippage and breakage capacities and should require
employers to obtain manufacturer's specifications and/or
certifications that a scaffold meets minimum standards. However, the
ACCSH did not endorse the suggested 4000 and 16,000 pound limits and
did not propose any other limits.</p>

<p>After a careful review of the above comments, OSHA has determined
that the capacity provisions set out in final rule &#167; 1926.451(a) will
appropriately address the concerns regarding scaffold strength and
that additional specifications would be redundant.</p>

<p>Issue 21 of the preamble to the NPRM requested public comment on
appropriate field test procedures or certifications for determining
the capacity of scaffolds and scaffold components such as planks and
ropes. As noted above, existing &#167; 1926.451(a)(7) and proposed
&#167; 1926.451(a)(1) require scaffolds to be capable of supporting, without
failure, at least four times the maximum intended load. OSHA has
recognized, however, that field testing of scaffolds and scaffold
components with loads four times greater than the maximum intended
load could cause damage that would render the scaffold and scaffold
components unusable.</p>

<p>One commenter (Ex. 2-54) mentioned reliance on testing laboratories
to ensure that rope and planks meet industry standards. Another
commenter (Ex. 2-64) stated that scaffolds' and support systems' rated
capacities should be marked when manufactured and that any field
testing beyond that set forth in a manufacturer's instructions would
be superfluous and could conflict with those instructions.</p>

<p>The SSFI (Ex. 2-367) and the SIA (Ex. 2-368) both stated that field
testing of supported scaffolds would permanently damage equipment or
render it useless, and that a visual check of the scaffolding before
use should ensure safety "as the manufacturer already warrants the
appropriate safety factors." The SIA also stated that current testing
methods "are not suitable for checking the ultimate capacity of
scaffold components." The SIA further stated that for metal
components, visual inspection is the only practical method available.
For wooden components, the SIA stated that inherent material variables
make obtaining repeatable results from a suitable bending test
impossible. On the other hand, the SIA recommended that suspension
scaffolds be field tested with the intended load.</p>

<p>Two other commenters (Ex. 2-495 and 2-534) agreed with the SIA that
it is impossible to obtain repeatable results from a bending test.
However, they stated that a minimum threshold design value for
flat-wise bending of planks could be derived from available
information for flat-wise bending for any specie of plank. Those
commenters also stated that field testing would not necessarily
permanently damage or render a plank useless. They stated that
strength testing of used planks could be accomplished by combining
visual inspections with deflection testing using a safe load and
deflection testing machines that are currently available.</p>

<p>One commenter (Ex. 2-516) indicated that a reasonable level of load
testing for scaffold machinery might be found "somewhere near 1.25
times [the] rated load" and that "any field tests should be a ratio of
rated load, not failure load." The commenter assumed different safety
factors for moving equipment, suspended scaffold hoists, and fixed
structures. The commenter also questioned whether the safety factor
referred to in Issue 21 was for static, dynamic, or shock loads, and
noted that 4 to 1 is not an engineering safety factor but a gross
factor. In addition, the commenter stated:</p>

<p>Any device or mechanism designed for a structural safety factor of
four-to-one certainly can be tested at some level less than
four-to-one without structural failure. * * * It is difficult to
comprehend the rationale of prohibiting testing of a structure using 1
1/2 times rated load for fear it will collapse, when the structure
must not collapse at 4 times rated load. There would then be doubt in
my mind as to its ability to meet that 4-to-1 criterion.</p>

<p>Also, the commenter (Ex. 2-516) pointed out that any test of wood
components should consider the effects of aging material, and he
listed a number of variables for which some testing adjustments would
be required. These variables included "fatigue, finish," and "material
test scales."</p>

<p>Two commenters (Exs. 2-13 and 2-69) indicated there would be no need
for field testing since scaffolds should be designed for their
intended load with an added safety factor. In particular, one of those
commenters (Ex. 2-13) stated "[t]here are no appropriate field tests
for such items as planks and ropes. A simple visual inspection is all
that is required by a competent person."</p>

<p>The ACCSH (Tr. pp. 163-174, 6-9-87) recommended that the
manufacturer's design specifications be recognized as sufficient for
manufactured scaffolds. The ACCSH also recommended that specifications
or testing procedures be specified for job-made scaffolds.</p>

<p>After carefully considering the above comments, OSHA has decided not
to require field testing of scaffolds. Based on the comments received,
the Agency has determined that such testing is not needed and that,
given the inspection and capacity requirements, it would be difficult
or impossible to implement effectively for the range of materials in
question.</p>

<p>Issue 23 of the preamble to the NPRM solicited comments on whether
or not the Agency should revise paragraph 1.(b) of proposed
non-mandatory Appendix A, which provides for selection of wood
scaffold planks according to the grading rules established by a
recognized independent inspection agency. In particular, OSHA asked if
the language should be more specific and, if so, what that language
should be.</p>

<p>Four commenters (Exs. 2-13, 2-22, 2-29, and 2-53) responded that the
proposed Appendix A language was adequate. One commenter (Ex. 2-13)
added "it should be mandatory that the employer visually check all
scaffold planks before they are used." Another commenter (Ex. 2-54)
stated that scaffold planks "should have identification" to indicate
that they are scaffold grade.</p>

<p>However, a commenter (Ex. 2-534) noted that "it may be premature to
require that all planks be so marked since agreement on methodology of
determining load displacement has not been reached by the engineering
profession."</p>

<p>The SSFI (Ex. 2-367) recommended that scaffold planks be marked, and
noted that the most plank failures are inspection related. The SIA
(Ex. 2-368) recommended that OSHA revise paragraph (b) of proposed
Appendix A to read, in part, as follows:</p>

<p>All solid sawn planking shall be `SCAFFOLD GRADE' plank and grade
stamped as appropriate per the published grading rules of the
recognized independent inspection agency and as approved by the Board
of Review of the American Lumber Standards Committee. The maximum
permissible spans for 2 x 10 inch (nominal 1 1/2 " x 9 1/4"
minimum dressed (S4S), 1 5/8" x 9 1/2" minimum rough or 2" x 10"
minimum rough, solid sawn wood planks shall be as shown in the
following table.</p>

<p>Paragraph 1(b) of Appendix A should be expanded and clarified to
eliminate the confusion that exists over the use of nominal thickness
scaffold grade planks on 10 ft. spans for light trades. This could be
achieved by defining a scaffold grade plank in the manner done in
Cal-OSHA standards.</p>

<p>Cal-OSHA Section 1637(e) requires what it calls a "structural plank"
for scaffold platforms as follows:</p>

<p>"Except as specified in certain other Orders, all planking shall be
2-inch (nominal) material selected for scaffold grade plank as defined
in Section 1504 under the heading Lumber--`Structural Plank'."</p>

<p>The ACCSH, in its June 9, 1987 (Tr. pp. 175-180), meeting,
recommended that a competent person be responsible for the selection
and use of scaffold materials, where scaffolding materials are not
certified by the manufacturer.</p>

<p>After carefully considering the above comments, OSHA has decided to
modify paragraph 1.(b) of non-mandatory Appendix A to the final rule
to provide for identification of scaffold planks by the grade stamp of
the recognized lumber grading association or independent lumber
grading inspection agency under whose grading rules the planks were
selected. OSHA is also modifying proposed Appendix A to provide that
the association or agency under which the wood is graded should be
certified by the Board of Review, American Lumber Standard Committee
as set forth in the American Softwood Lumber Standard of the U.S.
Department of Commerce. This added language clearly indicates what
constitutes a "recognized" inspection agency.</p>

<p>As a separate matter, OSHA is modifying Appendix A to the final rule
to provide that allowable spans of scaffold planks, other than 2 x 10
inch (nominal) or 2 x 9 inch (rough) solid sawn planks which are
addressed in the table in paragraph 1 (b), shall be determined in
accordance with the National Design Specification For Wood
Construction published by the National Forest Products Association or
with ANSI A10.8-1988, paragraph 5. OSHA notes that Appendix A is
intended to help the employer comply with the scaffolding rules. The
Agency believes that the above modifications will facilitate
compliance with those rules.</p>

<p>Paragraph (a)(6) of the final rule, which was not part of the
proposed rule, requires that scaffolds be designed by a qualified
person and must be constructed and loaded in accordance with that
design. OSHA believes that a "qualified" person can design a scaffold
which satisfies the criteria of &#167; 1926.451(a). This provision also
notes that non-mandatory Appendix A contains examples of criteria that
will enable employers to comply with paragraph (a) of this section.</p>

<p>Issue 24 of the preamble of the NPRM noted that existing
&#167;&#167; 1926.451(b)(16), (c)(4), (c)(5), (d)(9) and (g)(3) and proposed
&#167; 1926.451(b)(18)(i) and &#167;&#167; 1926.452(a)(10), (b)(10), (c)(6) and (i)(8)
require that an engineer design specified scaffold types and/or
components that are not built or loaded in accordance with Tables L-4
through L-13 of existing &#167; 1926.451 or proposed &#167; 1926.451 Appendix A,
respectively. OSHA asked for comments regarding the extent to which
the services of an engineer or of a qualified person would be needed
to design scaffolds in accordance with the provisions of Appendix A or
to design scaffolds that, while not in accordance with Appendix A,
would comply with &#167; 1926.451(a).</p>

<p>Two commenters (Exs. 2-69 and 2-437) responded that employers should
be allowed to assess whether individual employees with several years
of hands-on experience are capable of designing and modifying
scaffolds or an engineer's services are required. Also, a commenter
(Ex. 2-22) expressed the view that there was no need for further
licensing and determinations because employers are responsible for
ensuring that scaffolds meet regulations for capacity and that
alterations of scaffold designs are made by qualified individuals. The
AGC commenters (Exs. 2-20, 2-55, and 2-390) stated "there are many
individuals in the construction industry with many years of experience
who are quite capable of scaffold design and modification. Employers
should be permitted the flexibility to determine if such individuals
are capable or if they should seek the services of an engineer."</p>

<p>Another commenter (Ex. 2-54) noted that not all engineers are
capable of designing scaffolds and that a good many people who work
with scaffolds do not know all the scaffold limits or strengths. The
commenter acknowledged that complicated scaffold designs require the
skills of an engineer familiar with the equipment available. However,
the commenter added that a competent worker who has followed an
engineer's drawings to erect a scaffold can at times recall and use
that experience in another situation requiring a complicated scaffold
structure.</p>

<p>In addition, a commenter (Ex. 2-21) stated that no additional
specification requiring the use of engineering services was warranted.
The commenter explained that "[c]onditions on most construction jobs
change daily and can best be handled by qualified foremen or
supervisors on the job." Also, a commenter (Ex. 2-31), addressing
pumpjack scaffolds specifically, responded that although he was not an
engineer himself, he knew at least as much as anyone else about
pumpjack scaffolds. He felt that an engineer could be supplanted by
someone with recognized expertise but added that he did not believe a
specific definition of someone qualified to design a scaffold system
could be made.</p>

<p>Both the SSFI (Ex. 2-367) and the SIA (Ex. 2-368) recommended that a
"qualified person," as defined in proposed ANSI A10.8, be allowed to
design those scaffolds that would not require the services of a
registered engineer. They quoted the proposed ANSI definition as
follows:</p>

<p>A term describing one who, by possession of a recognized degree,
certificate, or professional standing, or who by extensive knowledge,
training, and experience, has successfully demonstrated the ability to
solve or resolve problems relating to the subject matter, the work, or
the project.</p>


<p>The suggested definition is identical to the definition of "qualified"
in &#167; 1926.32(l).</p>

<p>Two Saf-t-Green commenters (Exs. 2-14 and 2-15) stated that people
other than engineers were capable of designing scaffolds. In
particular, one commenter (Ex. 2-15) stated "There are many good,
practical scaffold designers who are not engineers. They should not be
excluded."</p>

<p>On the other hand, some responses to Issue 24 stated that the
services of a registered or professional engineer were needed (Exs.
2-3, 2-9, 2-13, 2-70, 2-128, and 2-516). One such commenter (Ex. 2-13)
stated that he backed using registered professional engineers "with
the knowledge and training required for [designing] a life support
system" and queried where "an equivalent qualified responsible person
could be found?" One commenter (Ex. 2-70) offered a brief response,
"when in doubt, consult an engineer." Another commenter (Ex. 2-516)
responded:</p>

<p>I would rather take my chances with the engineer [-designed scaffold
system]. At least he knows some limits. Any other definition lets
anyone determine by <b class="ITALICS">themselves</b> that they are eminently qualified. All
it then takes to be qualified is a big ego, a little knowledge, and a
pile of frame scaffold.</p>

<p>A comment from Aluma-Systems, Incorporated (Ex. 2-128) expressed the
belief that an engineer's services should be required for all but the
simplest of scaffold structures. The commenter indicated that the
Province of Ontario requires that a professional engineer design any
scaffold which exceeds 15 meters in height (approximately 50 feet),
any suspension scaffold where the scaffold consists of more than one
platform, or any suspension scaffold where the weight of the platform
and its components exceed 363 kg.</p>

<p>In addition, two commenters (Exs. 2-12 and 2-53) responded that the
existing regulations were sufficient or adequate. One of the two (Ex.
2-12) stated that there was already sufficient regulation and
questioned whether rules could be made to cover all situations.</p>

<p>In its June 9, 1987, meeting, the ACCSH (Tr. pp. 180-183)
recommended that OSHA authorize a competent person, rather than a
qualified person, to follow Appendix A for scaffold design, but that a
registered professional engineer be required to design scaffolds where
conditions are not covered by Appendix A. The Agency notes that a
competent person, as defined in &#167; 1926.32(f) and in the final rule
for subpart L, is able to detect hazards and has the authority to have
hazards corrected. On the other hand, "qualified", as defined in
&#167; 1926.32(m) and in the final rule for subpart L, refers to a person who
has the ability to solve or resolve safety and health problems.</p>

<p>After carefully considering the above comments, OSHA believes that
the proposed rule adequately addressed the conditions under which a
scaffold must be designed by an engineer. Accordingly, the
above-listed proposed requirements (&#167; 1926.451(b)(18)(i) [now final rule
&#167;&#167; 1926.451(d)(3)(i)] and 1926.452(a)(10), (b)(10), (c)(6), and (i)(8))
have been promulgated in the final rule. As discussed below, proposed
rules &#167;&#167; 1926.452(a)(10) and (b)(10) have been revised to distinguish
more clearly between those circumstances where the employer would need
the services of a registered professional engineer and those
situations where the services of a qualified person, who could refer
to non-mandatory Appendix A, would be sufficient.</p>

<p>The Agency believes that there are qualified persons who can
properly design scaffolds without reference to Appendix A. The Agency
also believes that there will be circumstances where the "qualified
person" retained to comply with paragraph (a)(6) will need to be a
registered professional engineer.</p>

<p><b class="ITALICS">Paragraph 1926.451(b) Scaffold Platform Construction</b></p>

<p>Paragraph 1926.451(b) of this final rule provides criteria for the
construction of scaffolds. Paragraph (b)(1) requires all platforms,
except walkways and those platforms used by employees performing
scaffold erection and dismantling operations, to be fully decked or
planked. In addition, paragraph (b)(1)(i) requires that platform units
be placed so that spaces between units do not exceed 1-inch, except
where employers establish that more space is needed. For example, this
would be necessary to fit around uprights when using side brackets to
extend platform width. Paragraph (b)(1)(ii) provides that, where the
exception created by paragraph (b)(1)(i) applies, employers shall
place platform units as close together as possible, with the space
between the platform and uprights not to exceed 9 1/2 inches. OSHA
set 9 1/2 inches as the maximum space allowed, because the minimum
width for scaffold units that could be expected to sustain a working
load is just over 9 1/2 inches. This provision, which is effectively
identical to the provision in the proposed rule, codifies the Agency's
longstanding interpretation of existing &#167; 1926.451(a)(4), which
addresses guardrails on scaffolds, to require that guardrails be
erected as close as possible to the platform planking. Because
guardrails normally can be conveniently attached only at the scaffold
uprights, OSHA has required the platforms to be sized such that there
is no gap between the outermost plank edge and the guardrail. However,
most prefabricated end frames do not have a lateral spacing between
uprights which can accommodate an integral number of
commercially-available planks. In order to comply with the existing
rule, some employers have modified the last plank (notched, slanted,
or cut it to size). This can lead to a significant reduction in plank
strength, and possibly cause tipping of the plank (sideways) if
eccentrically loaded. Therefore, to deal with this problem, proposed
and final rule paragraph (b)(1) have modified the corresponding
requirement of the existing standard by requiring the span between
uprights to be planked or decked as fully as possible, but allowing up
to 9 1/2 inches between the planking or decking and the guardrail
supports. As explained above, 9 1/2 inches is the maximum allowable
open space.</p>

<p>One commenter (Ex. 2-29) stated that the 1-inch opening allowed by
proposed paragraph (b)(1)(i) would be large enough to "allow many
tools and small materials to fall through", and recommended a maximum
space of 1/4 inch between units. OSHA, however, finds that such a
small maximum space would pose unreasonable compliance burdens, and is
retaining the 1-inch maximum.</p>

<p>The SSFI and the SIA (Exs. 2-367 and 2-368) stated that compliance
with proposed paragraph (b)(1) would be impossible when erecting or
dismantling scaffolds. In particular, the SIA (Ex. 2-368) stated:</p>

<p>For example: On a multi-level supported scaffold where construction
work is to be performed only at the top level, lower levels would not
be planked. Erectors would only use sufficient planks required to
construct the scaffold.</p>

<p>Load requirements limit the number of levels that can be planked on
many installations. The additional cost in labor and material would be
staggering. In addition, the fatigue factor created by installing full
planking from one level to the next would create a greater hazard to
the erectors.</p>

<p>The Agency agrees with the SIA comments and acknowledges that a
requirement to fully plank under these conditions would unreasonably
interfere with the erection and dismantling process. The Agency also
agrees that a requirement to fully plank every intermediate platform
level, where no work other than scaffold erection or dismantling
operations will occur, is overly burdensome. Therefore, OSHA has
revised proposed paragraph (b)(1), which already excepted walkways
from the requirement for full planking or decking, to add an exception
to the final rule to the planking requirements for erection or
dismantling operations. In a situation where no work, other than
erecting or dismantling the scaffold, is being done at intermediate
levels, the final rule requires only that the planking established by
the employer as necessary to provide safe working conditions for
employees erecting or dismantling the scaffold be used. On the other
hand, if scaffold erection or dismantling is being performed from an
intermediate level platform that is being or will be used as a work
area, that platform must be fully planked in accordance with paragraph
(b)(1).</p>

<p>Paragraph (b)(2) of the final rule requires that all scaffold
platforms and walkways be at least 18 inches (46 cm) wide, with lesser
widths allowed for ladder jack scaffolds, top plate bracket scaffolds,
pump jack scaffolds, roof bracket scaffolds, and boatswains' chairs,
and for scaffolds in areas shown to be too narrow to accommodate an
18-inch wide surface. Proposed paragraph (b)(2) also required a
minimum 18-inch width, with exceptions for ladder jack scaffolds (12
inches) and boatswains' chairs (any width). The rationale for setting
a 12-inch minimum width for ladder jack scaffolds, as discussed in the
preamble of the proposal (51 FR 42684-85), was the difficulty of
handling one 18-inch wide plank or two 9-inch planks on a ladder,
which the Agency considered more hazardous than working on a 12-inch
wide plank. In the final rule, OSHA has also included pump jack
scaffolds in the exception to paragraph (b)(2) for which a minimum
platform width of 12 inches is permitted, based on a commenter's
statement (Ex. 2-31) that OSHA's performance criteria for pump jack
scaffolds enable employees to work safely on platforms that are 12
inches or 14 inches wide. The commenter also indicated that requiring
pump jack scaffold platforms to be at least 18 inches, instead of 12
inches, wide would create "an economic hardship * * * for this very
prevalent size aluminum platform." OSHA agrees that pump jack
scaffolds with platforms as narrow as 12 inches can satisfy the
performance criteria of the final rule and has revised paragraph
(b)(2) accordingly.</p>

<p>In addition, the Agency is recognizing top plate bracket scaffolds
and adding them to the list of scaffolds which are permitted to have
platforms not less than 12 inches in width. As discussed above in the
definition section, these are supported scaffolds, similar to
carpenters' bracket scaffolds and form scaffolds, which consist of a
platform supported by brackets that hook over or are attached to the
top plate of a wall. These scaffolds are used in residential
construction for setting trusses, usually for high ceiling situations
(e.g., cathedral ceilings, atria). The Agency has determined that use
of this type of scaffold, even with a 12-inch wide platform, provides
greater protection for employees setting trusses than the use of
ladders, makeshift scaffolds or walking the top plate. OSHA concludes
that it would be less safe to require wider platforms for top plate
scaffolds because setting up this type of scaffold would then require
handling and positioning an 18-inch wide platform or two nine-inch
wide platforms, and handling and positioning larger, heavier brackets,
which is usually done from ladders. OSHA finds that this would be more
hazardous than working on one 12-inch wide platform equipped with fall
protection.</p>

<p>As proposed, OSHA is deleting the requirement that appeared in the
existing scaffold rule at &#167; 1926.451(l)(1), which sets the minimum
dimensions of a boatswains' chair at 12 inches by 24 inches, because,
with the advent of slings and molded seats, the Agency believes that
setting minimum dimensions is overly restrictive. This
performance-oriented approach is reflected by the inclusion of
language in paragraph (b)(2)(i) which specifically exempts boatswains'
chairs from any width requirements.</p>

<p>The SIA (Ex. 2-368) suggested that platforms as narrow as 12 inches
wide be allowed in areas where entryways are restricted. Another
commenter (Ex. 2-64) suggested that suspension scaffolds designed for
special applications (e.g., to fit through manholes) be permitted to
be as narrow as 12 inches. OSHA realizes that there may be instances
where the nature of the work being performed makes it impossible to
make platforms and walkways at least 18 inches wide. Where the
employer can establish that such a situation exists, the Agency will
accept platforms and walkways that are less than 18 inches wide,
provided both that such platforms and walkways are as wide as is
feasible and that employees are adequately protected from fall hazards
by the use of guardrails and/or personal fall arrest systems, as
required by paragraph (g).</p>

<p>Final rule paragraph (b)(3) (proposed as paragraph (b)(4)) sets the
requirements for the space between the front edge of a platform and
the face of the structure where the scaffold is being used. Paragraph
(b)(3) requires that, except as provided in paragraphs (b)(3)(i) and
(b)(3)(ii), the front edge of all platforms must be no more than 14
inches from the face of the structure, unless the employer implements
guardrail systems or personal fall arrest systems that comply with
paragraph (g) of the final rule to protect employees from falling
between the platform and the structure. Final rule paragraph (b)(3)(i)
requires that the front edges of outrigger scaffolds be no more than
three inches from the face of the structure, as is required by
&#167; 1926.451(g)(4) of OSHA's existing standard. Final rule paragraph
(b)(3)(ii) requires that the front edges of scaffolds used for
plastering and lathing operations be no more than 18 inches from the
face of the structure.</p>

<p>The 18-inch dimension was developed from data collected by Wang
Associates (Ex. 5) which show that a shorter distance between the
scaffold platform and the wall is not feasible for the operators of
plastering and lathing equipment because of interference with the
tools used during such operations. However, these same operations
cause the employee to stand back from the edge and the hazard of
falling is correspondingly reduced. The SIA (Ex. 2-368) supported the
18-inch provision as being necessary for the types of work covered,
while acknowledging that in some cases 14 inches would be adequate.</p>

<p>Final rule paragraph (b)(3) is effectively identical to proposed
paragraph (b)(4), except that the proposed provision specified "Type
I" guardrails instead of requiring compliance with paragraph (g). OSHA
has deleted the designations "Type I" and "Type II" from the final
rule for subpart L, as discussed above in relation to the definition
of "Guardrail system".</p>

<p>Existing &#167; 1926.451(a)(4) requires guardrails on all open sides and
ends of a scaffold platform, but does not specify how far away a
scaffold platform may be from a building before the side facing the
building is considered to be an "open side." OSHA's existing scaffold
rule has often been interpreted to mean that no open space is allowed.
However, zero clearance during all phases of construction is not
feasible. The 14-inch limit in proposed paragraph (b)(4) recognized
that during construction the face of the wall being built often moves
out toward the scaffolds. There must be sufficient space at the
beginning of work to allow for the installation of insulation,
lathing, plaster, masonry units, ledges, facings and other
architectural or structural additions. The spacing must be allowed for
from the start, because it is not practical to move large scaffolds
away from the wall as wall construction progresses outward. When the
initial set back distance must be more than 14 inches, the platform
can often still be kept within 14 inches of the building by the use of
side brackets or extensions on supported scaffolds, and by angulated
roping, static lines, or equivalent means on suspension scaffolds.</p>

<p>Two commenters (Exs. 2-41 and 2-465) questioned the use of 14 inches
in this provision, suggesting that a maximum of 12 inches be allowed.
While OSHA recognizes that the suggested 12-inch spacing could be
marginally more protective, the Agency also recognizes that, as
discussed above, in many cases an unobstructed working space of at
least 14 inches is necessary. OSHA also notes that ANSI A10.8-1988,
paragraph 4.5.9, allows up to a 16-inch space for supported scaffolds
and a 12-inch space for suspended scaffolds. In support of OSHA's
position, the SIA (Ex. 2-368) endorsed the proposed language as the
proper solution to the problem, while noting that it would prefer 18
inches. The Agency believes that the 14-inch space appropriately
addresses both the safety concerns and the need to allow necessary
room for many of the jobs normally performed from scaffolds.</p>

<p>Final rule paragraph (b)(4) requires each end of a platform unit,
unless cleated or otherwise restrained by hooks or equivalent means,
to extend over the center line of its support at least six inches (15
cm). This provision is virtually identical to proposed paragraph
(b)(5), which was based on existing &#167; 1926.451(a)(14). The use of
cleats, hooks, and similar securing devices would also be allowed as
alternatives to the six inch extension in the proposed and final
rules, because of their ability to restrain movement of platform
units.</p>

<p>OSHA received one comment (Ex. 2-40) on this provision, which
stressed the importance of securing platform units against movement.</p>

<p>Final rule paragraph (b)(5) (proposed paragraph (b)(6)) addresses
the maximum distance platform units may extend over their supports. In
particular, paragraph (b)(5)(i) provides that each end of a platform
unit 10 feet (3 m) or less in length shall not extend over its support
more than 12 inches (30 cm) unless the unit is designed, and installed
so that the cantilevered portion of the unit is able to support
employees or material without tipping or has guardrails which prevent
employee access to the cantilevered end. In addition, paragraph
(b)(5)(ii) provides that each platform unit greater than 10 feet in
length shall not extend over its support more than 18 inches (46 cm),
unless the unit is designed and installed so that the cantilevered
portion of the unit is able to support employees without tipping, or
that the unit has guardrails which block employee access to the
cantilevered end.</p>

<p>OSHA proposed to change the maximum overhang allowed by existing
&#167; 1926.451(a)(14) from 12 inches to 18 inches because many planks in use
are 10 feet long, and are used to span eight foot distances. OSHA also
notes that ANSI A10.8-1988, paragraph 4.17, limits planks from
extending more than 18 inches over their supports, without regard to
the length of the plank.</p>

<p>OSHA's thinking at the time of the proposal was that the existing
requirement was unnecessarily restrictive, and that strict adherence
to the existing maximum overhang limit would require platform units to
be cut if they extended beyond the 12-inch limit.</p>

<p>Although no comments were received on this provision, OSHA has
included, upon further consideration of this matter, that the maximum
overhang allowed, unless the above specified measures have been taken,
should be limited to 12 inches for planks 10 feet or less in length,
and 18 inches for planks greater than 10 feet in length. The Agency
concludes that allowing an 18-inch overhang as a matter of course
would be unsafe, because the weight of an employee on an 18-inch
overhang could easily tip a 10-foot plank. However, an 18-inch
overhang on a plank that is longer than 10 feet would be permissible
because the additional weight of the longer platform would offset the
weight of the employee on the overhang. In addition, an employer who
seeks to use platform units that overhang the supports more than the
prescribed distance would be required to satisfy the performance
criteria of paragraph (b)(5) of the final rule.</p>

<p>Under final rule paragraph (b)(6), where platform units are abutted
to create a long platform, each abutted end shall rest on a separate
support surface. Abutted platform units do not rest one on another,
but instead are end-to-end. Consequently, one unit does not support
the other, and proper support can only be provided by separate support
surfaces. This provision is virtually identical to proposed paragraph
(b)(7), except that the final rule has deleted the words "butt plate
or equivalent means of support", because those words add nothing to
the requirement for "separate support." This provision is based on
existing &#167; 1926.451(b)(12), which currently applies only to wood
pole scaffolds. OSHA has determined that all scaffolds need proper
platform support and, accordingly, has promulgated this provision.</p>

<p>The Agency has also added a note to this provision stating that
common support members such as "T" sections or hook-on platforms
designed to rest on common supports are not prohibited by this
provision. The Agency is doing this to prevent confusion since these
commonly used support members might be considered not to meet the
requirements of this provision.</p>

<p>Final rule paragraph (b)(7) provides that where platforms are
overlapped to create a long platform, the overlap shall occur only
over supports, and shall not be less than 12 inches (30 cm) unless the
platforms are nailed together or otherwise restrained to prevent
movement. This provision is virtually identical to proposed paragraph
(b)(8) which was based on existing &#167; 1926.451(a)(12).</p>

<p>Final rule paragraph (b)(8) requires that at all points of a
scaffold where the platform changes direction, such as turning a
corner, any platform that rests on a bearer at an angle other than a
right angle shall be laid first and platforms which rest at right
angles over the same bearer shall be laid second, on top of the first
platform. This provision is virtually identical to proposed paragraph
(b)(9), which was based on existing &#167; 1926.451(b)(13). While this
provision in OSHA's existing standard addresses only wood pole
scaffolds, OSHA has determined, as with final rule paragraph (b)(6),
that the existing requirement is appropriately applied to the
construction of all scaffold platforms.</p>

<p>Final rule paragraph (b)(9) provides that wood platforms shall not
be covered with opaque finishes, except that platform edges may be
covered or marked for purposes of identification. Platforms may be
coated periodically with wood preservatives, fire-retardant finishes,
and slip-resistant finishes, but the coating may not obscure the top
or bottom wood surfaces. This paragraph is intended to ensure that
structural defects in platforms are not covered from view by the use
of an opaque coating or finish. Hairline cracks can significantly
reduce the strength of a wood member, so early detection of structural
defects is important. Opaque finishes can cover such cracks and make
them difficult to discover. The edges of platform units are excepted
from this rule to allow identification marks, grading marks, or other
similar type of marks to be placed on the unit edges.</p>

<p>This provision is virtually identical to proposed paragraph (b)(10).
The proposal addressed the use of wood preservatives, fire retardant
finishes and slip-resistant finishes in a "note", while the final rule
has incorporated the pertinent language directly into the regulatory
text. In short, those finishes may be used as long as they do not
obscure the top or bottom wood surfaces.</p>

<p>Final rule paragraph (b)(10) requires that scaffold components
manufactured by different manufacturers not be intermixed unless the
component parts fit together without force and the resulting
scaffold's structural integrity is maintained by the user. Scaffold
components manufactured by different manufacturers shall not be
modified in order to intermix them unless the resulting scaffold is
determined by a competent person to be structurally sound. OSHA
expects that the competent person who evaluates the scaffold will have
the appropriate knowledge, skill and experience regarding scaffold
systems and components.</p>

<p>This provision is identical to proposed paragraph (b)(11), except
that the proposal did not contain the phrase "and the resulting
scaffold's structural integrity is maintained by the user". The SIA
(Ex. 2-368) suggested the added language, citing the "latest ANSI
A10.8 draft." The Agency acknowledges that a scaffold may lack the
requisite structural integrity even though the intermixed components
"fit together without force." OSHA agrees that the requirement to
maintain structural integrity should be clearly stated in this
provision and has revised the final rule accordingly.</p>

<p>One commenter (Ex. 2-29) stated "[m]any, if not all, scaffold
manufacturers void any liability if their scaffold components are
intermixed * * * A standard requirement should not result in a lesser
degree of safety; neither should it encourage an employer to take a
course of action that could increase his liability." The SSFI (Ex.
2-367) stated "[i]t would be the Institute's recommendation that
scaffold components not be intermixed even though they may re[a]dily
fit together without force. Many times the capacity or bracing
alignment would not be the same as other types of scaffold, thus
creating a hazardous situation." OSHA agrees that an unsafe condition
could exist when parts are intermixed, unless adequate precautions are
taken, and believes that paragraph (b)(10), as modified, in
conjunction with &#167; 1926.451(a), provides for adequate precautions to be
taken by the employer to ensure against this eventuality.</p>

<p>Paragraph (b)(11) of the final rule provides that scaffold
components made of dissimilar metals shall not be used together unless
a competent person has determined that galvanic action will not reduce
the strength of any component to a level below that required by
&#167; 1926.451(a). This provision, while effectively identical to proposed
paragraph (b)(12), differs from &#167;&#167; 1926.451(c)(1), (2) and (3) of
OSHA's existing rule, which prohibit the use together of any
dissimilar metals on tube and coupler scaffolds. The proposed rule was
intended to extend the prohibition to all scaffolds, because the
problem of dissimilar metals causing galvanic action can occur on any
scaffold, not just tube and coupler scaffolds. However, the proposed
rule was not intended to prohibit all uses of dissimilar metals
because there are many combinations which do not produce significant
galvanic reactions.</p>

<p>One commenter (Ex. 2-41) expressed skepticism as to the ability of a
competent person to discern that galvanic action has not reduced the
strength of any component. However, OSHA finds that any competent
person, as defined by this subpart, would be able to identify the
causes and significance of any deterioration in scaffold components.
In particular, OSHA expects the competent person, who is on site and
required to inspect the scaffold, to recognize deterioration due to
galvanic reactions, and to take prompt corrective action.</p>

<p><b class="ITALICS">Paragraph 1926.451(c) Criteria for Supported Scaffolds</b></p>

<p>Final rule &#167; 1926.451(c) sets criteria for the use of supported
scaffolds. Paragraph (c)(1) of the final rule requires that supported
scaffolds with a height to base width ratio of more than four to one
(including outrigger supports, if used) be restrained from tipping by
guying, tying, bracing, or equivalent means. That provision is based
on existing &#167; 1926.451(e)(1), which covers manually-propelled
mobile scaffolds. Any type of supported scaffold can topple if its
center-of-gravity is too high, and OSHA has therefore expanded the
coverage of this paragraph in the final rule. Final rule paragraph
(c)(1)(i) provides that guys, ties, and braces shall be installed at
locations where horizontal members support both inner and outer legs.
In addition, paragraph (c)(1)(ii) requires, as follows:</p>

<p>(1) Guys, ties, and braces shall be installed according to the
scaffold manufacturer's recommendations or at the closest horizontal
member to the 4:1 height and be repeated vertically at locations of
horizontal members every 20 feet (6.1 m) or less thereafter for
scaffolds 3 feet (0.91 m) wide or less and every 26 feet (7.9 m) or
less thereafter for scaffolds greater than 3 feet (0.91 m) wide;</p>

<p>(2) The top tie, guy or brace of a completed scaffold shall be
placed no further than the 4:1 height from the top; and</p>

<p>(3) Such guys, ties and braces be installed at each end of the
scaffold and at horizontal intervals not to exceed 30 feet (9.1 m)
(measured from one end [not both] towards the other).</p>

<p>This provision of the final rule is essentially the same as proposed
paragraph (b)(13), except that the maximum vertical spacing has been
changed to allow for the scaffolds to be supported at their strongest
points. Proposed paragraphs (b)(13)(i) and (b)(13)(ii), which
specified the horizontal spacing for ties, guys, and braces, were
intended to replace existing &#167; 1926.451 (b)(4), (c)(12), and
(d)(7). These paragraphs of the existing rule required pole scaffolds,
tube and coupler scaffolds, and fabricated frame scaffolds to be tied
and braced at intervals no greater than 26 feet vertically (25 feet
for wood pole scaffolds) and 30 feet horizontally (25 feet for wood
pole scaffolds). These paragraphs have been misinterpreted over the
years to mean that scaffolds less than 26 feet high by 30 feet long
(25 by 25 for wood pole scaffolds) do not need guys, ties, or braces.
Proposed paragraph (b)(13)(ii) was intended to replace the 26- and
25-foot vertical rule and require all scaffolds required by the 4 to 1
rule to have guys, ties, or braces also to have such connections
installed at each end of the scaffold and at horizontal intervals not
to exceed 30 feet (measured from one end only).</p>

<p>The following are examples of how this requirement is to be applied:
(a) If a scaffold is five feet wide, 18 feet high and 50 feet long, no
vertical or horizontal ties and braces are required because the height
is less than four times the width and the four to one rule does not
require connections; (b) if the scaffold is five feet wide, 50 feet
high, and 25 feet long, ties and braces are required at least at the
20- and 40-foot levels at both ends of the scaffold (four ties and
braces in all); (c) if the scaffold is five feet wide, 50 feet tall,
and 70 feet long, ties and braces are required at least at the 20- and
40-foot levels. These would be installed starting from either end, at
least at the zero, 30, 60, and 70-foot horizontal distances (eight
ties and braces in all).</p>

<p>The SSFI (Ex. 2-367) disagreed with the 20-foot limit for bracing
intervals in proposed paragraph (b)(13)(i) and suggested a 20-foot
limit for scaffolds 3 feet wide or less, and a 26 foot limit for
scaffolds more than 3 feet wide. In addition, this commenter suggested
that bracing be at bearing locations or as recommended by the
manufacturer. OSHA agrees with this commenter's suggested bracing
intervals, because the Agency believes that properly erected scaffolds
more than 36 inches wide are more stable than those which are
narrower, and has modified this provision of the final rule
accordingly.</p>

<p>The SIA (Ex. 2-368) stated:</p>

<p>We are in agreement with the proposed wording used to define the
location of guys and ties as a function of the scaffold base width
dimension. This proposed wording adequately defines where scaffolds
must be guyed or tied to achieve proper scaffold stability. To
correctly transmit the stabilizing forces through the scaffold,
however, the guys or ties must be placed at locations where horizontal
members support both the inner and outer legs. Guying or tying a
scaffold leg at mid span could buckle the leg and cause an unexpected
scaffold failure. To avoid this danger, it is recommended that the tie
be placed at the closest horizontal member above the 4:1 base to
height ratio and repeated vertically at locations of horizontal
members every 20 to 26 feet in height thereafter. The top tie shall be
placed no further than a 4:1 base to height ratio from the top.</p>

<p>OSHA agrees that guys, ties, and braces should be placed at points
of scaffold structural strength, and has modified this provision of
the final rule accordingly. Furthermore, the Agency agrees with the
SIA's recommendation that the top tie, guy, or brace be placed no more
than the 4:1 height to base ratio from the top of the scaffold, and
has modified the provision accordingly. However, OSHA does not agree
with the SIA suggestion that guys, ties and braces be installed at the
closest horizontal member <b class="ITALICS">above</b> the 4 to 1 base to height ratio, and
has revised the language of this provision to reflect the Agency's
finding that these components be installed at the closest horizontal
member <b class="ITALICS">to</b> the 4:1 height, whether above or below, to maximize
stability.</p>

<p>In addition, the SIA recommended that OSHA require employers to
consider loads due to wind and weather when guying, tying, or bracing
is installed, whenever scaffolds are partially or fully enclosed. The
Agency notes that these matters are addressed in the general capacity
requirements of final rule &#167; 1926.451(a) and in &#167; 1926.451(f)(13),
which requires that wind screens not be used unless the scaffold has
been secured against the forces imposed.</p>

<p>Another commenter (Ex. 2-38) suggested using the same language as in
existing &#167; 1926.451(e)(1), which requires that the height of a
manually propelled mobile scaffold not exceed four times the minimum
base dimension, "because it is more understandable." Also, a commenter
(Ex. 2-40) stated "since the standard does not address the issue of
cantilevered work platforms (or their effect on stability), the
allowable height to base width ratio of equal to four or less seems
high."</p>

<p>Another commenter (Ex. 2-23) recommended a ratio of 3 to 1, but
provided no rationale to support its suggestion. OSHA notes that the
final rule 4:1 ratio is consistent with the requirement in ANSI
A10.8-1988, paragraph 4.31, that free-standing scaffolds with height
to base ratios of more than 4:1 be restrained from tipping by guying
or other means.</p>

<p>Based on these concerns, in the final rule OSHA has added paragraph
(c)(1)(iii), which requires that scaffolds with eccentric loads (such
as cantilevered work platforms) be restrained from tipping through the
use of ties, guys, braces or outriggers.</p>

<p>Final rule paragraph (c)(2) requires that supported scaffold poles,
legs, posts, frames, and uprights bear on base plates and mud sills or
other adequate firm foundation. In particular, final rule paragraph
(c)(2)(i) requires that such footings be level, sound, rigid, and
capable of supporting the scaffold in a loaded condition without
settling or displacement.</p>

<p>In addition, final rule paragraphs (c)(2)(ii) and (iii) provide
that unstable objects shall neither be used to support scaffolds or
platform units, nor be used as working platforms, respectively. The
reason for these requirements is almost self-explanatory: every
scaffold must stand on a firm footing if it is to withstand the load
that employees, equipment, and materials place on it.</p>

<p>Final rule paragraph (c)(2)(iv) provides that front-end loaders and
similar pieces of equipment shall not be used as scaffold supports
unless they have been specifically designed by the manufacturer for
such use. In addition, final rule paragraph (c)(2)(v) requires that
fork-lifts not be used to support scaffold platforms unless the entire
platform is attached to the fork and the fork-lift is not moved
horizontally while the platform is occupied. Both these requirements
relate to the need for solid support for scaffold platforms and
reflect the fact that front-end loaders, fork-lifts and other such
equipment are not generally designed for this purpose.</p>

<p>Paragraph (c)(2) of the final rule is identical to proposed
paragraph (b)(14), except for two provisions, final rule paragraphs
(c)(2)(iv) and (v), which have been added based on input generated by
responses to Issue 3 of the preamble of the NPRM. Proposed paragraph
(b)(14) consolidated existing requirements that scaffold uprights rest
upon a stable, firm, level footing.</p>

<p>Issue 3 asked if OSHA should prohibit the use of cranes, derricks,
forklifts, front-end loaders, and similar pieces of equipment for the
support of scaffold platforms. In addition, OSHA asked what pieces of
equipment should be prohibited and what other related provisions would
be necessary to ensure employee safety.</p>

<p>Several commenters from the Associated General Contractors of
America (AGC) (Exs. 2-20, 2-55, and 2-390) and the ACCSH (Tr. 6/9/87,
pp. 40-41) noted that OSHA had undertaken rulemaking regarding the use
of cranes and derricks to hoist personnel platforms (NPRM published
February 17, 1984, 49 FR 6280). The AGC commenters stated that the
proposed regulations for crane suspended work platforms already
addressed the concerns raised in Issue 3.</p>

<p>Another commenter (Ex. 2-53) called for the development and issuance
of specific crane suspended platform regulations, and one respondent
(Ex. 2-29) commented that the current regulations on crane suspended
work platforms were acceptable.</p>

<p>On August 2, 1988 (53 FR 29116), OSHA issued a final rule
(&#167; 1926.550(g)) which regulates the use of cranes and derricks to hoist
personnel platforms. Therefore, there is no longer a need for subpart
L to address that subject.</p>

<p>Regarding the use of front-end loaders, one commenter (Ex. 2-33)
responded, in part, that "front-end loaders should not be used to
hoist worker-loaded scaffold platforms" and added that the "[u]se of
forklifts for this purpose should be limited in accordance with * * *
OSHA's General Industry Standards for powered industrial trucks, 29
CFR 1910.178(m)(12)." The same commenter also stated "If large
platforms are used in this manner, consideration should be given to
requiring bracing of forks to safeguard against tipping or slipping of
the truck or its forks."</p>

<p>Another commenter (Ex. 2-70) stated simply "[w]e do not utilize
forms of equipment to support platforms." Two other commenters (Exs.
2-367 and 2-368) stated "the practice of using cranes, derricks,
fork-lifts, etc., [to support scaffold platforms] is unsafe and should
be prohibited."</p>

<p>One commenter (Ex. 2-5), a manufacturer of heavy-duty
materials-handling equipment, including forklifts and cranes, stated
that "[f]or years, we have made the users of our equipment aware that
these are intended solely for the handling of materials and not for
personnel." The commenter went on to say their company recommends that
"OSHA develop rules prohibiting the use of forklifts, front-end
loaders and similar pieces of equipment for the support of scaffold
platforms," and provided the following rationale:</p>

<p>This class of equipment depends on a hydraulic cylinder(s) to lift
and hold the load[-]engaging means. When new, the cylinder has little
leakage past the sealing means, usually packings, but it does have
leakage. After use, the leakage increases. This allows the
load[-]engaging means to 'drift' downward, possibly endangering
personnel on the scaffold platform. Additionally, the load[-]engaging
means of a forklift are usually supported on bearings or sliding
members and chains. With use, wear occurs at these points. If
excellent maintenance is not performed, and worn parts [are not]
promptly replaced, sufficient wear can occur which is not evident when
handling heavy loads, since their gravitational mass overcomes the
friction and keeps the chain tight; however, when supporting a light
load such as a scaffold platform, there is insufficient mass to
overcome the friction with the load[-]engaging means left suspended
when the mechanism is lowered, with a sudden drop of the load[-]
engaging means when dislodged. We have knowledge of this happening at
least two times at Cape Kennedy when a work platform was raised by a
15,000 pound[-]capacity forklift of our manufacture. Each time serious
injury to the man on the platform occurred.</p>

<p>The ACCSH has recommended (Tr. 6/9/87, pp. 32-48) that OSHA prohibit
the use of front-end loaders and other similar earth-moving equipment
for scaffold support. ACCSH also recommended that OSHA develop rules
allowing the use of forklifts as scaffold platforms only while the
equipment is stationary and while proper fall protection is provided.</p>

<p>Several commenters (Exs. 2-13, 2-20, 2-22, 2-24, 2-54, 2-55, and
2-390) favored allowing the use of cranes, derricks, front-end loaders,
and forklifts to support scaffold platforms, in general terms. Three
other commenters (Exs. 2-29, 2-33, and 2-176) favored allowing the use
of forklifts, under specified conditions, to support scaffolds.</p>

<p>Three commenters from the AGC (Exs. 2-20, 2-55, and 2-390) stated
that, in certain instances, where access to a work area was difficult
and the work assignment was of short duration, using scaffold framing
might be more hazardous than using equipment for work platform
support. They added that appropriate personal protective equipment
could be used for employee safety in these situations.</p>

<p>Another commenter (Ex. 2-22) opposed the contemplated prohibition,
stating "[t]here are a variety of field situations in which the use of
such devices is the only safe way to handle a particular problem. Not
only is there no diminution in the safety level afforded to employees
in such situations, but the level of safety may actually be improved."</p>

<p>Also, a commenter (Ex. 2-24) termed the "suggestion that cranes,
forklifts, and other equipment could not be used as platform supports"
as "totally unrealistic." The commenter provided some alternatives and
examples (e.g., long ladders) describing them as involving the use of
generally dangerous equipment. The commenter also noted that when
using this equipment as scaffold support, additional protective
measures would be necessary. These measures would include having the
operator at the controls at all times, having railings on platforms
used above 10 feet in height, and providing safety training.</p>

<p>The Boston Cement Masons and Asphalt Layers Union (BCMALU) (Ex.
2-54) indicated that the use of this equipment to support scaffold
platforms might be practical in certain circumstances. This commenter
also added that employers "should note the use of this equipment in
their Daily Report and explain why they used it."</p>

<p>A carpentry contractor (Ex. 2-176) said that forklift scaffold(s)
with properly constructed scaffold platforms should be permitted,
provided they are equipped with proper railings, and added that "[i]f
the workers working from the scaffold do not ride up and down, there
is no danger of their falling off."</p>

<p>One commenter (Ex. 2-29) stated that "[f]orklift[-]mounted work
platforms might also be acceptable provided suitable requirements and
restrictions are specified." Another commenter (Ex. 2-13), expressing
guarded support of the possible prohibition, stated that since this
"equipment is readily available at job sites * * * [it] will continue
to be used to support workers at elevated working locations." The same
commenter further suggested that a minimum requirement for the safe
use of such equipment would be to have a competent engineer
responsible for the design and safe use of the resulting scaffold.</p>

<p>After a careful review of the above comments, OSHA finds there is
insufficient reason to totally ban the use of forklifts, front-end
loaders, and other similar equipment as scaffold supports. OSHA notes
that the commenters are in general agreement that all equipment not
specifically designed to support scaffold platforms must not be used.
Accordingly, the Agency has promulgated new paragraphs (c)(2)(iv) and
(v) in the final rule to provide guidance for the safe use of specific
equipment as scaffold supports. In particular, the added provision
requires that, in the case of fork-lifts, the entire scaffold platform
be secured to the forklift. <b class="ITALICS">All</b> supported scaffolds, including those
supported by forklifts, front-end loaders and similar pieces of
equipment, must comply with the applicable requirements of
&#167; 1926.451 for capacity, construction, access, use, and fall protection.</p>

<p>Paragraph (c)(3) of the final rule requires that supported scaffold
poles, legs, posts, frames, and uprights be plumb and braced to
prevent swaying and displacement. This provision, which is identical
to proposed paragraph (b)(15), consolidates existing &#167;&#167; 1926.451
(a)(15), (b)(1), (c)(6) and (e)(8), all of which require that uprights
be secure, plumb, and braced to prevent swaying and displacement of
the scaffold.</p>

<p><b class="ITALICS">Paragraph 1926.451(d) Criteria for Suspension Scaffolds</b></p>

<p>Final rule paragraph (d) sets criteria for the use of suspension
scaffolds. Paragraph (d)(1) of the final rule requires that all
suspension scaffold support devices, such as outrigger beams, cornice
hooks, parapet clamps, and similar devices, rest on surfaces capable
of supporting at least 4 times the loads imposed on them by the
scaffold operating at the rated load of the hoist (or at least 1.5
times the loads imposed on them by the scaffold operating at the stall
load of the hoist, whichever is greater).</p>

<p>Proposed paragraph (b)(16) required all suspension scaffold support
devices such as outrigger beams, cornice hooks, parapet clamps, and
similar devices, to rest on surfaces capable of supporting the
reaction forces imposed by the scaffold hoist operating at its maximum
rated load. Both the proposed and final rule are based on existing
&#167; 1926.451(h)(9), which requires that outrigger beams rest on
suitable wood bearing blocks. Final rule paragraph (d)(1) differs from
the proposed provision regarding the way in which the load to be
sustained is expressed. The proposed rule used the term "maximum rated
load" instead of the final rule's terms "rated load of the hoist" and
"stall load" of the hoist.</p>

<p>Three commenters (Exs. 2-64, 2-367 and 2-516) recommended a 4 to 1
safety factor based on the rated load of the hoist. Another commenter
(Ex. 2-41) stated that reaction force should include all forces, not
just those from the hoist, and indicated that some safety factor was
needed. The Agency agrees that a clarification is warranted here, and
has modified the final rule to reflect this input. In addition, the
text has been modified to be consistent with final rule &#167;&#167; 1926.451
(a)(2) and (a)(4). The Agency concludes that this is necessary in
order to adequately address the issue of the hoist reaching its stall
load when the scaffold strikes an obstruction. OSHA has determined
that the hoist stall capacity needs to be greater than the hoist rated
capacity so that the rigging system will be able to support the loads
imposed by obstructions as well as the load being lifted. This matter
is addressed in greater detail above, in relation to final rule
&#167; 1926.451(a)(1).</p>

<p>Final rule paragraphs (d)(2), (d)(3) and (d)(4) set requirements for
outrigger beams used with suspension scaffolds. Paragraph (d)(2) of
the final rule requires that suspension scaffold outrigger beams, when
used, be made of structural metal, or equivalent strength material,
and be restrained to prevent movement. This is identical to proposed
paragraph (b)(17), except as discussed below. The proposal was based
on existing &#167;&#167; 1926.451(h)(4) and (k)(8).</p>

<p>The SIA (Ex. 2-368) stated that if the intent of proposed paragraph
(b)(17) was to prohibit the use of wood outrigger beams, the Agency
should simply say so. The proposed language clearly indicated that
outrigger beams must be made of structural metal. However, upon
further consideration of this provision, OSHA believes that other
materials should be allowed if their strength and other pertinent
characteristics are equivalent to those of structural metal. The
Agency has therefore revised the proposed rule accordingly. This
revision is in line with the Agency's policy to permit alternative
materials or practices which provide equivalent protection to
employees. Also, OSHA has added the words "when used" to indicate
clearly that the provision does not <b class="ITALICS">require</b> outrigger beams to be used
but only applies when outrigger beams are used.</p>

<p>Final rule paragraph (d)(3) sets requirements for the stabilization
of outrigger beams. The introductory language of the paragraph
requires that outrigger beams be secured directly to the supporting
surface or be stabilized using counterweights, except that masons'
multi-point adjustable suspension scaffolds shall not be stabilized by
counterweights. The rule does not allow counterweights for stabilizing
such masons' suspension scaffolds because, with the large loads often
placed on masons' multi-point adjustable suspension scaffolds and the
large counterweights that would be necessary to anchor such systems,
OSHA is concerned that the supporting roof or floor would become
dangerously overloaded.</p>

<p>Final rule paragraph (d)(3) is identical to proposed paragraph
(b)(18), except for a few minor editorial changes as described below.
The final rule clarifies existing &#167;&#167; 1926.451 (h)(4) and (j)(5),
which require simply that outriggers be securely fastened or anchored.
Counterweights are not addressed in the existing standard. OSHA has
determined that it is necessary to set criteria for counterweights in
the final rule, however, because counterweights are often the only way
to anchor an outrigger beam without damaging the supporting surface.</p>

<p>Paragraph (d)(3)(i) provides that direct connections shall be
evaluated by a competent person who affirms, based on that evaluation,
that supporting surfaces can support the anticipated loads. In
addition, the paragraph requires masons' multi-point adjustable
suspension scaffold connections to be designed by an engineer
experienced in such scaffold design. OSHA anticipates that compliance
with these provisions will ensure that roof or floor decks are capable
of supporting the loads to be imposed.</p>

<p>Final rule paragraphs (d)(3)(ii) through (d)(3)(v) require that
counterweights be made of non-flowable material; be specifically
designed for use as scaffold counterweights; be secured to outrigger
beams to prevent accidental displacement; and not be removed from an
outrigger beam until the scaffold is disassembled, respectively. These
requirements are necessary to ensure that counterweights are used only
for their intended purpose and are not displaced or removed
prematurely.</p>

<p>Final rule paragraphs (d)(3)(vi) through (d)(3)(x) set requirements
for securing outrigger beams. In particular, outrigger beams not
stabilized by direct connections to the supporting surface shall be
secured by tiebacks (paragraph (d)(3)(vi)). Tiebacks must be as strong
as the suspension ropes (paragraph (d)(3)(vii)), be secured to a
structurally sound anchorage (paragraph (d)(3)(ix)), and be installed
perpendicular to the structure unless opposing angle tiebacks are
installed (paragraph (d)(3)(x)). In addition, paragraph (d)(3)(viii)
requires that outrigger beams be placed perpendicular to their bearing
support, with the exception described more fully below.</p>

<p>With regard to proposed paragraph (b)(18)(i) (paragraph (d)(3)(i) in
the final rule), a commenter (Ex. 2-40) stated "we believe that
improper connections are almost always responsible for the failure of
scaffolds. Therefore, criteria for torsion strength evaluation of
bolted (direct) connections should be included in the standard." OSHA
believes that the corresponding requirement in final rule paragraph
(d)(3)(i) for evaluation of direct connections by a competent person
will provide adequate assurance that those connections are designed
and made appropriately, because the competent person must have the
ability to identify any problems with the direct connections and the
authority to have any problems corrected.</p>

<p>Proposed paragraph (b)(18)(ii) (paragraph (d)(3)(ii) in the final
rule) required that counterweights be made of non-flowable solid
material. That, in effect, prohibited the practice of using sandbags
or water-filled buckets as counterweights. The reason for the
prohibition is that counterweights are easily displaced and may leak.
Final rule paragraph (d)(3)(ii) is virtually identical, except that
the word "solid" has been deleted, because that term is redundant with
the term "non-flowable", and a sentence has been added that explicitly
prohibits the use of sand, gravel and other similar material as
counterweights.</p>

<p>A commenter (Ex. 2-41) stated that the proposed paragraph would
cause confusion, inquiring whether, if five 70 pound weights are
considered "solid," 350 one pound weights also would be considered
"solid"? The Agency would consider five 70 pound weights as meeting
this requirement, because objects of this weight would be unwieldy and
less prone to dislocation. However, 350 one pound weights would not
meet this requirement because their light weight would make them more
prone to being dislocated, thus possibly compromising their
effectiveness as a counterweight. OSHA has added the sentence "Sand,
gravel, and similar materials that can be easily dislocated shall not
be used" to indicate more clearly what materials are not allowed for
use as counterweights.</p>

<p>Paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of the final rule requires that counterweights
be specifically designed for use as counterweights. This provision,
which was not part of the proposed rule, has been added in response to
input received regarding Issue 26 in the preamble of the NPRM. That
Issue asked if OSHA should require that counterweights be designed for
no other purpose than to counterweight the system, thereby prohibiting
the use of construction materials, such as concrete masonry units,
rolls of felt, etc., as counterweights.</p>

<p>One commenter (Ex. 2-22) opposed requiring that counterweights be
designed for no other purpose than to counterweight the system. This
commenter stated that such a requirement would be unnecessarily
costly. This commenter also stated "So long as the material used meets
the objective of the safety requirement, there is no need to cause the
expenditure of money on specific materials that do not enhance the
safety of the employee * * *"</p>

<p>Several commenters (Exs. 2-13, 2-29, 2-43, 2-53, 2-54, 2-64, 2-367,
2-368 and 2-465) supported a requirement that counterweights be
specifically designed for no other purpose than to counterweight the
system. These commenters also supported a ban on the use of
construction material as counterweights. The SIA (Ex. 2-368) added
that such a requirement would be practical, feasible, of negligible
cost and would prevent accidents which occur when construction
materials used as counterweights are removed for other purposes.</p>

<p>Another commenter (Ex. 2-13) stated:</p>

<p>Counterweights should be designed for their specific use and
permanently marked with their weight otherwise they are worthless.
Construction material, of any kind, should be banned for use as
counterweights. There is no assurance that proper counterweighting is
being accomplished with construction materials. Also, the material
could be removed for use by others, thus providing an unstable
condition.</p>

<p>Two commenters (Exs. 2-64 and 2-367) stated that there should be a
requirement that counterweights be identified or marked. The SSFI (Ex.
2-367) recommended that "each counterweight be identified as to its
weight" and should also "have the ability to be fastened directly to
the outrigger system." Another commenter (Ex. 2-64) wanted
counterweights to be "clearly marked with their actual weight
(stamped, painted, etc.), so that workers will use the proper amount
of weight."</p>

<p>In addition, a commenter (Ex. 2-8) stated "[c]onstruction materials
should not be use[d]. We have seen masons remove block used as
counterweight."</p>

<p>Also, the ACCSH (Tr. pp. 188-190, 6-9-87) recommended that
counterweights be designed for no other purpose than to counterweight
the system. One member stated "Certainly OSHA should require
counterweights be designed for no other purpose. It seems to me that
the same day I first read this question I received from OSHA a copy of
`Fatal Facts' that involved this very issue."</p>

<p>After carefully considering the above comments and the ACCSH
recommendation, OSHA has determined that it is reasonably necessary to
require that counterweights be designed for no other purpose than to
counterweight the system, and to prohibit the use of construction
materials as counterweights. In addition, OSHA has determined that it
is appropriate to require the marking of counterweights with their
weights because that information is needed for the proper design,
selection and installation of counterweights.</p>

<p>Proposed paragraph (b)(18)(iii), which required that counterweights
be connected to outrigger beams by mechanical means, is identical to
final rule paragraph (d)(3)(iv), except that the phrase "to prevent
accidental displacement" has been added to the final rule to clarify
the Agency's regulatory intent. The BCMALU (Ex. 2-54) recommended that
the Agency clarify the reason for this provision. The Agency agrees
and has revised the provision accordingly.</p>

<p>Proposed paragraph (b)(18)(iv) required that counterweights not be
removed from a scaffold until the scaffold is disassembled. Final rule
paragraph (d)(3)(v) is identical to the proposed paragraph, except
that the final rule specifies that the counterweights may not be
removed from the "outrigger beam", rather than from the "scaffold."
One commenter (Ex. 2-41) pointed out that counterweights used with
suspension scaffold outrigger beams are not placed on the scaffold, as
stated in the proposed rule, but are installed on the outrigger beam
above. The Agency agrees, and has revised the provision accordingly.</p>

<p>Proposed paragraph (b)(18)(v) required outrigger beams to be secured
by tiebacks equivalent in strength to the suspension ropes. This
provision was intended to provide a backup system in case the
counterweights became displaced. Although tiebacks alone may not keep
a scaffold from tipping, they will keep the system from falling to the
ground and from causing a progressive failure of nearby scaffolds and
scaffold sections. The intent of the proposed paragraph has been
carried forward in final rule paragraphs (d)(3)(vi) and (vii), which
require the use of tiebacks when direct connections are not used, and
require tieback strength equivalent to that of the suspension ropes,
respectively.</p>

<p>The SSFI and the SIA (Ex. 2-367 and 2-368) noted that outrigger
beams which are bolted to the structure become part of the structure
and do not require tiebacks. The Agency agrees that only
counterweighted outrigger beams need to be secured with tiebacks and
has incorporated appropriate language into paragraphs (d)(3)(vi) and
(d)(3)(vii) accordingly.</p>

<p>In addition, final rule paragraph (d)(3)(viii) requires that
outrigger beams be placed perpendicular to the face of the structure,
except that, where the employer establishes that such placement is
prevented by obstructions, the outrigger shall be placed as near to
the perpendicular as possible and shall be secured using opposing
angle tiebacks. This provision has been added as a partial response to
a commenter (Ex. 2-41) who stated that requiring tiebacks to be
installed parallel to the centerline of the beam, as required by
proposed paragraph (b)(18)(vii), is only safe when the beam is
perpendicular to the edge. OSHA agrees with this comment because a
non-perpendicular beam/tieback arrangement creates a pendulum effect
that could endanger employees. However, the SIA (Ex. 2-368) has
pointed out that there may be circumstances where obstructions prevent
the outrigger beam from being placed perpendicular to the edge. The
SSFI and the SIA (Exs. 2-367 and 2-368) suggested that, in such
cases, opposing angle tiebacks be required. OSHA agrees that opposing
angle tiebacks are appropriate where obstructions prevent
perpendicular placement of outriggers, and has revised the final rule
language accordingly.</p>

<p>Proposed paragraphs (b)(18)(vi) and (vii) required that tiebacks be
secured to structurally sound anchorages and that they be parallel to
the outrigger beam. Those provisions correspond to final rule
paragraphs (d)(3)(ix) and (x). OSHA has revised this language,
drawing on examples in the preamble of the NPRM, to provide more
specific direction regarding what constitutes a structurally sound
anchorage.</p>

<p>Three AGC commenters (Exs. 2-20, 2-55 and 2-390) stated that the
OSHA interpretation of what is considered an acceptable point of
anchorage (51 FR 42686) was too strict and that the Agency should
permit the use of any available roof structural anchor points since
they are only accommodating a back-up or secondary support system. The
Agency disagrees with this position because the secondary support
system must be capable of providing adequate support in the event of
rigging failure. The revised final rule paragraph specifically
identifies structural members of the building or structure as
appropriate anchor points, and identifies standpipes, vents, other
piping systems, and electrical conduit, as structural elements that do
not provide appropriate anchorages.</p>

<p>Proposed paragraph (b)(18)(vii) required that tiebacks be installed
parallel to the centerline of the beam. The proposed language has been
revised in final rule paragraph (d)(3)(x) to recognize that opposing
angle tiebacks are acceptable alternative means of installation. In
addition, OSHA has replaced the proposed term "parallel", with the
term "perpendicular" for the sake of clarity.</p>

<p>A commenter (Ex. 2-29) stated "since tieback anchorages are not
always available exactly where needed, perhaps the wording of these
requirements should be revised to allow tiebacks to be at an angle,
e.g., not to exceed 10 degrees from the centerline of the outrigger
* * *." OSHA acknowledges that anchorages are not always conveniently
located and that there may be circumstances where it is necessary to
install the tieback at an angle. However, OSHA believes that when this
is done, it is also necessary to require an opposing angle tieback to
be used so that the pivot radius of the beam is minimized.
Consequently, single tiebacks installed at an angle are not allowed by
the final rule.</p>

<p>Paragraph (d)(4) of the final rule specifies the construction
requirements for outrigger beams used with suspension scaffolds. This
provision requires that suspension scaffold outrigger beams be:
provided with stop bolts or shackles at both ends; securely fastened
together with the flanges turned out when channel iron beams are used
in place of I-beams; installed with all bearing supports perpendicular
to the beam center line; and set and maintained with the web in a
vertical position. In addition, when an outrigger beam is used, the
shackle or clevis with which the suspension rope is attached to the
outrigger beam shall be placed directly over the hoisting machine,
i.e., over the center line of the stirrup. (These requirements are
found in paragraphs (d)(4)(i) through (d)(4)(v).)</p>

<p>These requirements are effectively identical to those in proposed
paragraph (b)(19). The SIA (Ex. 2-368) recommended that OSHA drop the
word "single" from proposed paragraph (b)(19)(v) because this
requirement applied to all outrigger beams, not just to "single
outrigger beams". The Agency agrees, and has revised this provision of
the final rule accordingly.</p>

<p>Final rule paragraph (d)(5) sets requirements for suspension
scaffold support devices other than outrigger beams. These devices
include cornice hooks, roof irons, parapet clamps, or similar devices.
Under this provision, those devices must be: made of steel, wrought
iron, or materials of equivalent strength; supported by bearing
blocks; secured against movement by tiebacks installed at right angles
to the face of the building or structure unless opposing angle
tiebacks are installed and secured to a structurally sound point of
anchorage on the building or structure (sound points of anchorage
include structural members, but do not include standpipes, vents,
other piping systems, or electrical conduit); and tiebacks shall be
equivalent in strength to the strength of the hoisting rope.</p>

<p>Final rule paragraph (d)(5) is identical to proposed paragraph
(b)(20), except that some minor editorial changes have been made for
the sake of clarity. In particular, OSHA has revised proposed
paragraph (b)(20)(i), which specified "mild steel, wrought iron, or
equivalent materials," by deleting the word "mild" and changing
"equivalent materials" to "materials of equivalent strength." These
revisions are based, in part, on input from a commenter (Ex. 2-41),
who indicated that the term "mild steel" is not defined in readily
available sources. The other change was made to indicate clearly that
the strength of the specified materials was the characteristic by
which `equivalence' would be gauged.</p>

<p>Proposed paragraph (b)(20)(iii) required the use of tiebacks,
installed at right angles to the face of the structure wherever
possible; secured to a structurally sound portion of the building; and
equivalent in strength to the hoisting rope. As stated in the preamble
to the NPRM (51 FR 42686), vents, standpipes, other piping systems,
and electrical conduits are not acceptable points of anchorage because
they are often made of materials that cannot support the loads that
would be imposed on them if the support device were to fail. OSHA has
revised the proposed provision so that final rule paragraph
(d)(5)(iii) allows opposing angle tiebacks, as well as tiebacks at
right angles, and has incorporated the NPRM preamble list of
unacceptable anchorage points to facilitate compliance. In addition,
the Agency has relocated the requirement for tieback strength
equivalent to that of the hoisting rope to a separate provision (final
rule paragraph (d)(5)(iv)).</p>

<p>Two commenters (Exs. 2-64 and 2-368) suggested a requirement that
devices covered by proposed paragraph (b)(20) be marked to indicate
their capacity. OSHA has not done so because the Agency believes that
such markings are not necessary given the capacity requirements set in
final rule &#167; 1926.451(a).</p>

<p>Paragraph (d)(6) of the final rule specifies the minimum length of
suspension rope to be used with different kinds of hoists. In
particular, winding drum hoists are required to have at least four
wraps of suspension rope at the lowest point of scaffold travel. All
other types of hoists are required to have suspension rope long enough
to lower scaffolds to the level below, without having the rope end
pass through the hoist, or to have the rope end configured or provided
with means so that the end does not pass through the hoist.</p>

<p>This provision, which is identical to proposed paragraph (b)(21),
elicited one comment. The BCMALU (Ex. 2-54) recommended that OSHA
require that the rope be long enough to allow the scaffold to be
lowered to the lowest point on the job-site without the rope passing
through the hoist or that the scaffold be initially set up at the
highest point at which it will be used on that job-site. OSHA believes
that the proposed provision adequately addressed the issue of rope
run-through and, accordingly, has not made the suggested revision in
the final rule.</p>

<p>Final rule paragraph (d)(7) states "The use of repaired wire rope as
suspension rope is prohibited." This provision differs from proposed
paragraph (b)(22), which stated "The repairing of wire suspension rope
is prohibited." The proposed requirement was based on OSHA's view that
there is no way to determine the strength capacity of a repaired wire
rope without the danger of over-stressing the repair and thus
rendering the rope unsafe for use on scaffolds. The Agency recognizes
that the proposed rule did not clearly state OSHA's intent. The act of
repairing wire suspension rope is not in itself hazardous. OSHA is,
however, concerned that repaired rope not be used to suspend a
scaffold. Accordingly, OSHA has revised this provision to prohibit the
use of repaired wire rope as suspension rope.</p>

<p>Paragraph (d)(8) of the final rule provides that wire suspension
ropes shall not be joined together except through the use of eye
splice thimbles connected with shackles or coverplates and bolts. This
is virtually identical to proposed paragraph (b)(23). This provision,
which was not in OSHA's existing scaffold standard, reflects OSHA's
determination that the specified measures are the only acceptable ways
to connect wire ropes without significantly affecting rope strength.</p>

<p>The SSFI and the SIA (Exs. 2-367 and 2-368) suggested revision of
the proposed text to read "wire suspension ropes shall not be joined
together except through the use of eyesplice thimbles connected with
shackles or cover plates and bolts." OSHA agrees that the suggested
phrase "through the use of eye splice thimbles connected" expresses
the Agency's intent more effectively than the proposed phrase "by
eyesplicing" and has revised the language of the final rule
accordingly. The SIA further indicated that this requirement should
apply only to wire suspension ropes used with manual hoists. However,
the Agency concludes that final rule paragraph (d)(8) is applicable to
the joining of all wire suspension rope, not just that which is used
with manual hoists, because compliance with that provision is
necessary to ensure that the wire ropes on <b class="ITALICS">all suspended scaffolds</b> are
rigged properly. Therefore, OSHA is not making the suggested change.</p>

<p>Paragraph (d)(9) of the final rule provides that the load end of
wire suspension ropes shall be equipped with proper size thimbles and
secured by eye splicing or equivalent means. This provision is
identical to proposed paragraph (b)(24), which was based on existing
&#167; 1926.451(h)(10) and existing &#167; 1926.451(j)(7).</p>

<p>Final rule paragraph (d)(10) requires that ropes be inspected for
defects by a competent person prior to each workshift and after every
occurrence which could affect a rope's integrity. In addition,
paragraph (d)(10) provides that wire rope shall be replaced if the
rope has any physical damage which impairs its function and strength;
any kinks that might impair the tracking or wrapping of rope around
the drum(s) or sheave(s); six randomly distributed broken wires in one
rope lay or three broken wires in one strand in one rope lay;
abrasion, corrosion, scrubbing, flattening or peening causing loss of
more than one-third of the original diameter of the outside wires;
evidence of any heat damage resulting from a torch or any damage
caused by contact with electrical wires; or evidence that a secondary
brake has been activated during an overspeed condition and engages the
suspension rope (paragraphs (d)(10)(i) through (vi)).</p>

<p>Proposed paragraph (b)(25) provided simply that "Defective or
damaged ropes shall not be used as suspension ropes or drop lines."
The proposed language was based on existing &#167; 1926.451(w)(5), which
prohibits damaged ropes from being used on float or ship scaffolds.
The danger of a broken line is a problem not confined to float or ship
scaffolds, so OSHA has extended this provision in the final rule to
cover all suspended scaffolds.</p>

<p>The one comment (Ex. 2-38) on the proposed provision pointed out
that guidelines indicating when rope would be considered to be
defective should be provided. The Agency agrees that employers need to
know what OSHA means by "defective or damaged rope". Accordingly,
final rule paragraph (d)(10) incorporates the language of ANSI
A10.8-1988, paragraph 6.7.10, because OSHA finds that those consensus
provisions represent good industry practice.</p>

<p>Paragraph (d)(11) of the final rule requires that swaged attachments
or spliced eyes on wire suspension ropes not be used unless they are
made by the wire rope manufacturer or a qualified person. This
provision is essential to ensure the strength and integrity of such
attachments as eyes and is identical to proposed paragraph (b)(26).</p>

<p>Paragraph (d)(12) of the final rule requires that, when wire rope
clips are used on suspension scaffolds, there shall be a minimum of 3
wire rope clips installed, with the clips a minimum of 6 rope
diameters apart; employers shall follow the manufacturer's
recommendations when installing clips, retightening clips after
initial loading, and inspecting and retightening clips at the start of
each workshift; U-bolt clips (a variety of wire rope clip) shall not
be used at the point of suspension for any scaffold hoist; and when
U-bolt clips are used, the U-bolt shall be placed over the dead end of
the rope, and the saddle shall be placed over the live end of the
rope.</p>

<p>Proposed paragraph (b)(27) simply stated "When wire rope clips are
used on suspension scaffolds, they shall be retightened after initial
loading and shall be inspected and retightened periodically
thereafter". OSHA believed at the time of the proposal that such
performance language conveyed the requirements necessary to ensure
that clips were installed and retightened properly.</p>

<p>Two commenters (Exs. 2-23 and 2-54) recommended that OSHA specify
the minimum number of clips required. In particular, one commenter
(Ex. 2-23) recommended a minimum of 3 clips spaced at least 6 rope
diameters apart, with the U-bolt over the dead end of the wire rope.
This commenter added that the clips must not be staggered.</p>

<p>The SIA (Ex. 2-368) recommended that the clips be tightened to the
manufacturer's recommended torque. Another commenter (Ex. 2-64)
suggested that only "J" type clamps be used on suspension scaffold
lines and that the clips be inspected and retightened at the start of
each workshift thereafter.</p>

<p>The Agency agrees that more specific requirements are needed so that
employers know how to install and retighten wire rope clips. OSHA
believes that the requirements of ANSI A10.8-1988, paragraph 6.7.11.3,
appropriately address the concerns raised by commenters, and has
incorporated those provisions into paragraph (d)(12) of the final
rule. In addition, the Agency agrees that a minimum of 3 clips spaced
at least 6 rope diameters apart is necessary for safe rigging when
wire rope clips are being used. OSHA notes that several drawings in
ANSI A10.8-1988 which depict the proper rigging of suspension
scaffolds show three wire rope clips on the suspension ropes.</p>

<p>Final rule paragraph (d)(13) requires that suspension scaffold
power-operated hoists and manually operated hoists be of a type tested
and listed by a qualified testing laboratory. This is virtually
identical to proposed paragraph (b)(28), except that OSHA has revised
the proposed terms "mechanically powered" and "manually powered"
hoists to read "power operated hoists and manually operated hoists" in
the final rule. This revision brings paragraph (d)(13) into line with
the language of ANSI A10.8-1988, paragraph 6. This provision
consolidates existing provisions &#167;&#167; 1926.451 (h)(2), (i)(3),
(j)(2), and (k)(1).</p>

<p>Paragraph (d)(14) of the final rule requires that gasoline-powered
equipment and hoists not be used on suspension scaffolds. This
provision is similar to proposed paragraph (b)(29), except that the
final rule now prohibits all gasoline-powered equipment or hoists, not
just gasoline powered hoists.</p>

<p>The proposed provision was based on existing &#167; 1926.451(k)(2)
which allows units to be either electrically or air motor driven. OSHA
has determined that gasoline hoists pose unacceptable fire hazards,
given the confined area of a suspended scaffold and the difficulties
employees would face trying to escape the scaffold if the hoist was
incapacitated and on fire.</p>

<p>The BCMALU (Ex. 2-54) strongly recommended that OSHA prohibit the
use of all gasoline-powered equipment and hoists on suspension
scaffolds because of the high potential for fire. The commenter cited
an example of an accident in which two employees were severely burned
using a gasoline-powered water blaster. The Agency agrees with this
concern and has revised the provision in the final rule accordingly.</p>

<p>Paragraph (d)(15) of the final rule requires that gears and brakes
of power operated hoists used on suspension scaffolds be enclosed.
This is virtually identical to proposed paragraph (b)(30), except a
change in terminology has been made ("mechanically powered" to "power
operated"), consistent with the changes made and discussed above under
paragraph (d)(13). The proposed rule was based on existing
&#167; 1926.451(k)(3).</p>

<p>Final rule paragraph (d)(16) provides that, in addition to the
normal operating brake, suspension scaffold power operated hoists and
manually operated hoists shall have a braking device or locking pawl
which engages automatically when a hoist makes either of the following
uncontrolled movements: an instantaneous change in momentum or an
accelerated overspeed. This provision is different from proposed
paragraph (b)(31), which required a brake or pawl to automatically
engage "when the normal speed of descent of the hoist is exceeded."
The proposed provision was based on existing &#167; 1926.451(k)(4) but
differed from the existing standard in that it applied to manual as
well as to powered hoists.</p>

<p>One commenter (Ex. 2-8) stated that OSHA should modify the proposed
provision to specifically address an instantaneous change in momentum
and an accelerated overspeed. OSHA agrees that the suggested revision
is appropriate, noting that ANSI A10.8-1988, paragraph 6.3.4.1
addresses both instantaneous stopping type secondary brakes and
deceleration type secondary brakes. The Agency has revised the final
rule's language accordingly.</p>

<p>The SSFI and the SIA (Exs. 2-367 and 2-368) recommended that OSHA
apply this requirement only to powered hoists. OSHA disagrees with
these commenters, noting that, as written, the provision requires a
braking device (for powered hoists) or a locking pawl (for less
sophisticated or manual hoists). The Agency concludes that these
precautions are necessary on all suspension scaffold hoists and,
accordingly, has not made the suggested revision.</p>

<p>Paragraph (d)(17) of the final rule provides that "Manually operated
hoists shall require a positive crank force to descend." This is the
same requirement as proposed paragraph (b)(32), except the term
"manually operated hoists" replaces the proposed term
"manually-powered hoists" for the same reasons as discussed above in
relation to final rule paragraphs (d)(13) and (d)(15).</p>

<p>Issue 27 in the preamble to the NPRM sought comments regarding
proposed &#167; 1926.451 (b)(32) (paragraph (d)(17) of the final rule) which
addresses means of preventing "free-running" of hoists during descent.
OSHA's view was that compliance with the proposed paragraph would
preclude this dangerous condition.</p>

<p>One commenter (Ex. 2-31), whose remarks related solely to pumpjack
scaffolds, stated that "[u]nder ordinary circumstances, free[-]running
does not occur during descent of a pumpjack."</p>

<p>The ACCSH recommended requiring a positive crank force to lower a
scaffold (Tr. 190-191, 6/9/87). The SSFI (Ex. 2-367) and the SIA (Ex.
2-368) commented that the proposed provision would preclude the use of
a "boat winch" type system. The SIA further noted that, to their
knowledge, free-running hoists are "rare in the marketplace." They
added that the requirement was feasible and practical and would
involve negligible additional cost. NIOSH (Ex. 2-40) agreed with the
proposed provision. The BCMALU (Ex. 2-54) stated that although a
positive crank force might be slower than a free-running hoist, it
would be safer which "is the name of the game, safety."</p>

<p>One commenter (Ex. 2-29) stated that a positive crank force should
be required for hoists used to lower manually-powered scaffolds.
Another commenter (Ex. 2-53) stated that the proposed requirement is
needed. In addition, a commenter (Ex. 2-64) stated that a positive
crank force is essential unless the descent speed can be controlled by
some other means.</p>

<p>After carefully considering the above comments and the ACCSH's
recommendation, OSHA has determined that this requirement is necessary
to eliminate the dangerous condition of "free-running" hoists during
descent and to ensure employee safety.</p>

<p>Final rule paragraph (d)(18) provides that two-point and
multi-point suspension scaffolds shall be tied or otherwise secured to
prevent them from swaying, as determined necessary based on an
evaluation by a competent person. This paragraph requires, in
addition, that window cleaners' anchors not be used for the purpose of
preventing swaying. This prohibition is based on the fact that window
cleaners' anchors are not designed for the load that could be imposed.
This provision was not part of the proposed rule.</p>

<p>Issue 7 in the preamble of the NPRM asked if the existing
&#167; 1926.451(i)(9) and proposed &#167; 1926.452(p)(5) requirement that employers
secure two-point adjustable suspension scaffolds to prevent swaying
should be extended to cover all suspended scaffolds.</p>

<p>Six commenters (Exs. 2-13, 2-22, and 2-43, 2-471, 2-494, and 2-516)
expressed some measure of support for the idea of extending this
provision to cover all suspended scaffolds.</p>

<p>One commenter (Ex. 2-13) stated as follows:</p>

<p>All exterior scaffolds should be stabilized at each work location or
provide a method of stabilization as described in OSHA 1910.66
[powered platform standard for General Industry] or by Intermittent
Stabilization, as contained in OSHA STD 1-3.3. In addition, all new
buildings over 35 feet in height should be provided with a permanent
engineered methods or means of rigging.</p>

<p>The vast majority of suspended scaffold accidents that do occur are
due to deficient rigging.</p>

<p>A later comment from the same individual (Ex. 2-494) stated "[w]ith
prior planning, there are ways that all scaffolds can be stabilized *
* * Unstabilized scaffolds are a hazard to the occupants, other
workers, and pedestrians below."</p>

<p>Another commenter (Ex. 2-471) stated as follows:</p>

<p>Any shear wall, with the technology available since November 1982,
as described in OSHA Instruction STD 1-3.3, can be made safe by the
installation and the use of Intermittent Stabilization Building
Anchors, to prevent a suspended scaffold from being displaced by wind
forces.</p>

<p>Merely providing perimeter protection and separate safety lines will
<b class="ITALICS">not</b> prevent the scaffold and its occupants from being blown about,
being upset, or violently contacting the structure being serviced, all
of which could cause death or injury.</p>

<p>Two commenters (Exs. 2-64 and 2-368) stated that it is neither
possible nor practical to tie in all suspended scaffolds. They stated
that there are many job situations (e.g., sheer or glass walls, or no
wall at all) where stabilization would not work because there are no
points where tie-ins can be made. OSHA acknowledges that there are
circumstances where suspension scaffolds used in construction have no
structure against which to be secured. The present rulemaking takes
into account the likelihood that "permanent engineered methods" or
"intermittent stabilization building anchors" will not be in place
during construction operations. The applicability of 1910.66 and
OSHA STD. 1-3.3 is limited because they apply to post construction
scaffold activities (such as window washing and light building
maintenance).</p>

<p>The BCMALU (Ex. 2-54) simply expressed support for the existing
requirement that two-point suspension scaffolds be secured to prevent
swaying.</p>

<p>Three commenters from the AGC (Exs. 2-20, 2-55, and 2-390) said that
single-point suspension scaffolds do not have a tendency to sway. They
explained that "[s]waying generally occurs on two-point suspensions
because of uncoordinated movements by two or three employees working
on the platform as well as the fact that larger platforms permit
movement by employees. This is not the case in single-point
suspensions."</p>

<p>Another commenter (Ex. 2-29) stated that "[s]ingle-point boatswains'
platforms should not be included [under this provision] * * * since
this would greatly restrict their use."</p>

<p>OSHA agrees with the AGC commenters that single-point scaffolds
should not be covered by this provision because, by their nature, they
do not have a tendency to sway. Single-point scaffolds generally
consist of a seat or a small cage which prevents employee movement and
scaffold swaying, and therefore, do not pose the same hazard as
multi-point scaffolds.</p>

<p>One commenter (Ex. 2-41) stated "based on much research, it is my
opinion that the primary purpose for suspended scaffold restraint on a
platform which has no open sides is to prevent the walking-working
surface from becoming unstable during normal work activities. The
restraint also closes the open side during work activities * * *" In
addition, the SIA (Ex. 2-368) noted that "[w]here the work platform is
provided with guardrails on all sides and workers are protected by * *
* safety lines, the protection should be adequate." Another commenter
(Ex. 2-516) noted that "[t]here may be limited situations where
suspended scaffolds for construction cannot be tied into the building
or structure. However, this is not a reason for not having [fall]
protection. Any suspended platform not tied in then definitely needs
guardrails on all four sides."</p>

<p>In response to Issue 7, the ACCSH recommended (Tr. 79-87, June 9,
1987) that, where determined necessary by a competent person, all
suspended platforms be secured to prevent swaying. The Advisory
Committee indicated that the expertise of the competent person would
enable the employer to determine the situations where it was
appropriate to secure suspended scaffolds against swaying.</p>

<p>After careful consideration of the comments received, OSHA has
decided not to require the use of tie-ins to protect single-point
suspended scaffolds from swaying. As noted above, this type of
scaffold generally consists of a seat or small cage which limits
employee movement and swaying. However, the Agency does agrees with
the ACCSH that the expertise of a competent person will enable the
employer to determine when it is appropriate to secure two-point and
multi-point suspended scaffolds and has worded the final rule
accordingly.</p>

<p>In addition, Issue 18 in the preamble of the NPRM asked if there
should be a height limit above which single and two-point adjustable
suspension scaffolds may not be used, and if so, what the height
should be, and why.</p>

<p>Four commenters (Exs. 2-20, 2-55, 2-69, and 2-390) responded by
asking "what type of equipment could be used above the limit that
would be safe, practical, feasible and economical?" One commenter (Ex.
2-69) added that the hoist lifting capacity is the only height
limitation for this type of scaffold. Another commenter (Ex. 2-13)
agreed with that point and stated that OSHA should not try to limit
the working height of suspension scaffolds. Two other commenters (Exs.
2-22 and 2-64) simply agreed that there should not be a height
limitation. One of those commenters (Ex. 2-22) added that following
"the safety standards" eliminates unsafe conditions.</p>

<p>Some Issue 18 commenters (Exs. 2-41, 2-54, 2-312) felt that the
height of a suspended scaffold was not a problem. One commenter (Ex.
2-41) stated that a "height limit in construction should not be a
factor in the safe use of equipment." As an example, he observed that
"single-point scaffolds have been used in 950 foot elevator shafts for
elevator installation * * *" The BCMALU (Ex. 2-54) indicated that a
greater height would make workers more aware of hazards and thus more
cautious. The commenter also stated "[i]t seems most employers and
employees are more safety conscious in high places and careless at 5
to 10 feet from the ground." In addition, he commented that he did not
see how OSHA could restrict use of this equipment because there are
situations where these types of scaffolds are the only equipment that
can be used. Also, a commenter (Ex. 2-312) stated that "[w]e have
outfitted chimney workers for years so they could work on chimneys
that stood 800 to 1000 feet in height. Never a single accident
reported." The commenter explained that descent devices and the chair
board systems use "one friction principle" and for these, more rope
means more friction with which to slow descent. In addition, the
commenter recommended that subpart L require that all rope [for these
suspended scaffolds] be continuous length of line, without splices.
The commenter further noted that this requirement would limit the
height somewhat.</p>

<p>The SSFI and the SIA (Exs. 2-367 and 2-368) expressed opposition to
a height limitation for suspended scaffolds and recommended that "the
equipment should be designed by competent persons who will take into
consideration all the hazards involved, thereby providing safe
equipment for the specific job function." In addition, the SIA (Ex.
2-368) stated that suspended scaffolds are practical and feasible at
any height when properly installed and used, and that the height
limitation "would be the ability of the hoist(s) to raise and lower
the work platform." Another commenter (Ex. 2-465) stated that this
equipment should be designed by a competent person "who is thoroughly
familiar with the hazards involved." That commenter also stated that
suspended scaffolds are the most feasible and safest methods to use
for work on smoke stacks, towers, and water tanks.</p>

<p>At its meeting of June 9, 1987, the ACCSH responded to Issue 18 by
reiterating the position they previously adopted under Issue 7
regarding two-point suspended scaffolds. (Issue 7 is discussed above
in reference to paragraph (d)(18) of the final rule.) While the ACCSH
did not favor adopting a height limitation for single- and two-point
adjustable suspended scaffolds, they did recommend that these types of
scaffolds be secured to prevent swaying where necessary, as determined
by a competent person (Tr. 6/9/87, pp. 148-150). One ACCSH member
stated "I would move that if swaying is prohibited, as discussed in
Question Number 7, that no height limit for suspended scaffolds need
be included."</p>

<p>Based on the input received, OSHA has determined that suspended
scaffolds which comply with the pertinent requirements of subpart L
will be safe regardless of the height at which they are used.
Therefore, the Agency has not added a height limitation to the final
rule.</p>

<p>Final rule paragraph (d)(19) (proposed &#167; 1926.451(b)(3)) requires
that single function emergency escape and rescue devices not be used
as working platforms. This paragraph also provides that the
prohibition does not apply to systems which are designed to function
both as working platforms and as emergency systems.</p>

<p>Proposed paragraph (b)(3) simply prohibited the use of emergency
descent devices as working platforms because such devices are not
normally designed for repeated in-place use. However, as stated in the
preamble to the NPRM (51 FR 42685), the proposed provision was not
intended to preclude the use of scaffold systems which have as an
additional feature the capacity to function as an emergency descent
device.</p>

<p>The proposed provision generated a number of comments (Exs. 2-8,
2-27, 2-29, 2-87 and 2-312) which recommended that OSHA define
"emergency descent device." Most of these commenters interpreted the
regulatory language as prohibiting all emergency descent devices from
being used as work platforms despite the clarification provided in the
preamble. Therefore, OSHA has revised the final rule to indicate
clearly that only devices whose sole function is to provide emergency
escape and rescue are not to be used as working platforms.</p>

<p><b class="ITALICS">Paragraph 1926.451(e) Access</b></p>

<p>Final rule paragraph (e) sets the requirements for safe access to
scaffolds. This paragraph clarifies the requirements of existing
&#167; 1926.451(a)(13), which requires only that "an access ladder or
equivalent safe access shall be provided." The introductory text
states that employers must provide scaffold access which complies with
paragraph (e) for each affected employee. It also specifies that the
access requirements for employees erecting or dismantling supported
scaffolds are prescribed in paragraph (e)(9).</p>

<p>Proposed paragraph (c) began with a note which stated that the
proposed paragraph did not apply to employees erecting or dismantling
scaffolds. In the preamble to the NPRM (51 FR 42687), OSHA stated that
requirements for safe access "often are not feasible until a scaffold
has been erected and properly braced." OSHA relied on the same
rationale for the proposed exemption of erectors and dismantlers from
the fall protection requirements of proposed paragraph (e).</p>

<p>OSHA received no comments on this proposed exemption directly.
However, many of the comments on Issue 8, which requested input
regarding the need to exempt employees erecting and dismantling
scaffolds from the fall protection requirements of proposed paragraph
(e) (promulgated as paragraph (g) of this final rule) stated that
employees erecting and dismantling scaffolds should not be exempted
from protection. In particular, as discussed below in relation to
final rule paragraph (g), commenters stated that it was often feasible
to provide fall protection for employees erecting or dismantling
scaffolds.</p>

<p>Given the evidence that employers can often protect erectors and
dismantlers from fall hazards, OSHA concluded that it was also
appropriate to consider if there are circumstances where safe access
can be provided for those employees. Accordingly, the Agency reopened
the subpart L rulemaking record to solicit input regarding the
proposed exemption (58 FR 16509, March 29, 1993). In particular, OSHA
sought comments about employers' ability to provide safe access for
erectors and dismantlers, the hazards that could be created by efforts
to provide safe access, and the criteria to be satisfied by employers
seeking to qualify for an exception from the proposed requirements for
safe access.</p>

<p>Three commenters (Exs. 34-8, 34-22, and 34-29) supported an access
requirement for scaffold erectors and dismantlers. One commenter (Ex.
34-8) said that its support depended on adding the words "or
equivalent means" to such a requirement. OSHA notes that both proposed
&#167; 1926.451(c)(1) and final rule &#167; 1926.451(e) contain the words "or
equivalent means." That commenter also stated that in utility boiler
installations "ladders and/or stairways are incorporated into
scaffolding. Planking and ladders, where feasible, are used to support
erection or dismantling. New access can be provided by cutting out
sections of the boiler wall, but the cost for it in some areas may be
prohibitive." The commenter added that safe access can be provided on
supported scaffolds 100&#37; of the time in non-boiler installations.</p>

<p>Another commenter (Ex. 34-22) stated that where safe access cannot
be provided, fall protection can be used. In addition, a commenter
(Ex. 34-29) responded that safe access is practically always feasible,
and presented ladders, lifts, and crane personnel baskets as examples.
OSHA agrees that safe access can be provided for erectors and
dismantlers in most instances through the use of various types of
equipment, including (but not limited to) ladders, scaffold stairs,
manlifts, and fall protection equipment. However, the Agency notes
that the use of a ladder or fall protection equipment would require a
significant degree of scaffold stability, which may not be present in
an incomplete scaffold. Additionally, the safe use of stair towers,
manlifts or crane personnel platforms is dependent on site conditions
and the availability of the equipment and additionally requires the
employer to comply with the regulations covering that equipment.</p>

<p>Scaffold Consultants (Ex. 34-5) described a hypothetical situation
involving a scaffold 100 feet long by 50 feet high and planked on all
levels. They raised the following points:</p>

<p>1. How many ladders are to be installed? If there is a ladder in the
middle of the scaffold, certainly an erector will not walk 50 feet to
a ladder and then back another 50 feet to relocate.</p>

<p>2. Ladders cannot be installed on the interior of the scaffold
because of the continuous, fully planked decking.</p>

<p>3. If more than one ladder is to be installed, then it would of
necessity be on the outside of the scaffold, forcing the erector to go
outside the scaffold on each succeeding level, exposing the worker to
a fall potential. Traditionally, each ladder section is installed
after that level of scaffold has been completed, and the worker no
longer has need to return to a lower level. You cannot install a
ladder section for the next level up until the scaffold frames,
bracing and planking have been erected.</p>

<p>The code already states (&#167; 1926.451(a)(13)) that an access ladder or
equivalent safe access shall be provided.</p>

<p>OSHA notes that providing safe access for erectors and dismantlers
does not necessarily mean that all levels of a scaffold must be fully
planked. In addition, the Agency cannot specify the number of ladders
or other means of access that must be provided in all cases, because
of the wide range of situations being addressed by this standard.</p>

<p>Regarding access for employees erecting or dismantling suspended
scaffolds, two commenters (Exs. 34-32 and 34-39) stated that access is
not required because suspended scaffolds are usually erected at ground
level and the rigging is performed at the roof level. Another
commenter (Ex. 34-8) stated that OSHA should consider deleting the
proposed exemption as it relates to suspended scaffolds. OSHA agrees
that if a scaffold is erected at ground level and rigging is performed
at the roof level, employees are deemed to have safe access to and
from the scaffold. However, erection and rigging not performed in this
manner require safe access to be provided, in accordance with final
rule paragraph (e).</p>

<p>Five commenters (Exs. 34-31, 34-32, 34-37, 34-39, and 34-43)
opposed, in general, an access requirement for erectors and
dismantlers. One commenter (Ex. 34-43) stated that the means of access
would have to be removed from a scaffold before dismantling can
proceed. In addition, four commenters (Exs. 34-9, 34-10, 34-12, and
34-17) stated that, while sectional ladders attached at the ends of
the scaffold can be used for access once adequate support is
available, portable ladders on the work platform may create a greater
hazard. Furthermore, three commenters (Exs. 34-32, 34-37, and 34-39)
stated that providing such access is not practicable on supported
scaffolds on the grounds that not all scaffolds require an attached
access and when one is required "it is installed after the lift is
installed," and "it is not available for the erectors."</p>

<p>In particular, the SIA (Ex. 34-37) stated that supported scaffold
erectors access the scaffold as the erection/dismantling process
progresses in either direction. Although acknowledging that erectors
also access the scaffold from structures or ladders when convenient,
the SIA added that access systems cannot be installed until the
scaffold is structurally sound, which they stated does not occur in
most cases until the scaffold is complete. OSHA finds, however, that
there are many circumstances where outriggers, braces, ties, guys, and
similar equipment can be used as the erection or dismantling processes
proceed in order to secure, stabilize, or reinforce the lower levels
of the scaffold so that safe access can be provided to these completed
levels.</p>

<p>OSHA realizes that there may be instances where safe access cannot
be provided to the actual level where employees are erecting or
dismantling supported scaffolds. However, the Agency has determined
that it is necessary and appropriate to provide these employees with
safe access to and egress from the levels that have been completed.</p>

<p>Another commenter (Ex. 34-11) wrote that most jobs would not meet
the requirements of proposed &#167; 1926.451(c) without an exemption for
erectors and dismantlers. This commenter called for a study to
determine what procedures are needed to provide safe access. OSHA
finds, however, that the rulemaking record provides the necessary
support for promulgation of access requirements for these employees
and, accordingly, has not adopted this commenter's suggestion. OSHA
intends to monitor the effectiveness and compatibility of final rule
paragraphs (e) and (g) carefully for the next several years, to make
sure they are providing the necessary protection for construction
workers. Based on the results of that monitoring, the Agency will
determine if any further action is warranted.</p>

<p>Several commenters responded to OSHA's request for information about
any hazards that would be created through efforts to comply with
proposed paragraph (c). One commenter (Ex. 34-8) stated "[i]n utility
boiler installations hazards may outweigh benefits. Employees may
attempt to use a ladder that is not properly secured. Would have to
install more access doors and this is not always feasible. In other
applications of supported scaffold problems are not anticipated."</p>

<p>Four commenters (Exs. 34-9, 34-10, 34-12 and 34-17) stated:</p>

<p>Use of ladders, etc. to provide access to levels that are in the
process of being dismantled would increase the potential to falls.
This is [due] to the fact that the scaffold would no longer be stable
enough to support the access equipment properly. The levels of
scaffold [that] have been completely erected or not yet dismantled
should retain the permanent access equipment intended to provide
access throughout the length of intended service. The risks involved
during the erection and dismantling process can be lessened by strict
adherence to all procedures.</p>

<p>As discussed above, OSHA has determined that safe access can be
provided to levels that have been completely erected or to levels that
remain intact during dismantling operations.</p>

<p>Three commenters (Exs. 34-32, 34-37 and 34-39) stated "[t]hese
hazards cannot be eliminated during scaffold erection." In addition,
two of the commenters (Exs. 34-32 and 34-39) stated "[t]he erector
travels both horizontally and vertically and may not be in the
vicinity of an access system when descent is necessary. He may not be
able to get safely to the access area if, for instance, planks have
been moved. Most scaffolds are not fully planked and planks are moved
as erection progresses."</p>

<p>On the other hand, two commenters (Exs. 34-11 and 34-29) said that
providing safe access for erectors and dismantlers would not create
hazards.</p>

<p>One commenter (Ex. 34-8) stated that employers should have their
scaffolds evaluated by a competent person and that OSHA should
consider erection and dismantling processes and procedures, accident
statistics, and the type of work to be done on the scaffold before
determining in a given situation that safe access is feasible.</p>

<p>Four commenters (Exs. 34-9, 34-10, 34-12 and 34-17) stated
"[c]ertainly the potential for greater risk should be the greater
consideration. The circumstance that bears the most consideration is
`at what point is the scaffold capable of supporting a ladder or other
access device'. At the point that this occurs permanent access ladders
will be able to be attached to provide access." Those commenters also
stated that an employer seeking exemption should be able to
demonstrate that compliance with proposed paragraph (c) would create a
greater hazard, be technologically infeasible, or be economically
infeasible.</p>

<p>Three commenters (Exs. 34-32, 34-37, and 34-39) stated that
providing a means of access to a scaffold under construction should
not be required because scaffold erectors are trained to safely climb
scaffolds and because worker access to a completed scaffold may be
directly from the structure itself. The commenters further stated this
would make adding an access system expensive and unnecessary. Those
commenters also contended that a requirement to prove infeasibility
would be expensive and time consuming, and is not supported by
accident data.</p>

<p>In response to comments asserting a lack of accident data to support
imposing burdens on employers whose employees erect or dismantle
scaffolds, NIOSH (Ex. 34-40) stated "[t]he lack of `accident
statistics' to scaffold erectors is likely to be due to insufficient
detail in injury surveillance data, and not necessarily to a lack of
injuries." In addition, NIOSH reviewed the accident data (Ex. 21) and
concluded that "[t]he fatality rate for scaffold erectors during
scaffold erection and dismantling exceeds that for the entire U.S.
construction industry." A review of construction accident reports
shows that 10-20&#37; of scaffold deaths and injuries occur during
erection and dismantling; OSHA finds that many of these will be
prevented by the final rule's fall protection requirements for these
operations (see the Benefits Chapter of the Economics Analysis for
this rule).</p>

<p>The Agency notes that the Occupational Safety and Health Review
Commission has held (Hoffman Construction Company, 6 OSHRC 1274,
January 4, 1978) that the safe access requirement of the existing
standard (29 CFR 1926.451(a)(13) does not become operative until the
scaffold is completed or use is imminent, and, therefore, does not
apply to scaffold erection and dismantling operations.</p>

<p>OSHA has determined that although scaffold erectors and dismantlers
are exposed to significant access-related hazards, requiring employers
to provide safe access for erectors and dismantlers in all cases would
often create a greater hazard or be infeasible. For example,
commenters have described factors (e.g., instability of scaffold and
lack of adjacent support) which can preclude the provision of safe
access. The Agency agrees that there are some situations where an
exemption from final rule paragraph (e) would be appropriate. However,
other commenters have indicated that employers who carefully evaluate
their scaffold operations can provide safe access or at least minimize
employee exposure to hazards during these operations. Therefore, OSHA
finds that it is appropriate for employers to be able to obtain relief
from the access requirements when such relief has been determined, on
a case by case basis, to be necessary. Accordingly, the Agency has
added final rule paragraph (e)(9), discussed below, which requires
(paragraph (e)(9)(i)) that employers have a competent person assess
pertinent workplace conditions and decide what means of access is
appropriate to use to protect the safety of erectors and dismantlers
on any particular job.</p>

<p>Final rule paragraph (e)(1) provides that access to and between
scaffold platforms more than two feet (0.6 m) above or below the point
of access shall be by portable ladders, hook-on ladders, attachable
ladders, scaffold stairways, stairway-type ladders (such as ladder
stand), ramps, walkways, integral prefabricated scaffold access, or
equivalent means, or by direct access from another scaffold,
structure, personnel hoist, or similar surface. In addition, the final
rule requires that crossbraces not be used as a means of access. This
provision is identical to proposed paragraph (c)(1), except for some
minor changes in terminology made in order to be consistent with
existing industry terms, and the inclusion of scaffold stairways as
another acceptable means of access. The final rule consolidates and
updates existing &#167; 1926.451(e)(5), which requires that ladders or
stairways be provided and used on mobile scaffolds; existing
&#167; 1926.451(q)(3), which requires that connecting runways with
substantial guardrails be used for access to plasterers', decorators',
and large area scaffolds; and existing &#167; 1926.451(y)(9), which requires
that ladders be used for pumpjack scaffold access.</p>

<p>The SSFI and the SIA (Exs. 2-367 and 2-368) recommended the
inclusion of scaffold stair/towers (scaffold stairways) as a
recognized acceptable means of access. The Agency acknowledges that
scaffold stairways are used regularly for scaffold access and agrees
that those stairways should be addressed by subpart L. Accordingly,
OSHA has incorporated regulatory text addressing scaffold stairways
into final rule paragraph (e)(4), discussed below.</p>

<p>Paragraph (e)(2) of the final rule sets requirements for portable,
hook-on and attachable ladders. A note to this paragraph indicates
that additional requirements for the proper construction and use of
portable ladders are contained in subpart X of this part--Stairways
and Ladders--of the construction standards.</p>

<p>In particular, final rule paragraph (e)(2)(i) provides that
portable, hook-on, and attachable ladders shall be positioned so as
not to tip the scaffold.</p>

<p>In addition, final rule paragraphs (e)(2)(ii)-(vi) provide that
hook-on and attachable ladders shall have bottom rungs positioned not
more than 24 inches (61 cm) above the scaffold supporting level; have
rest platforms at 35 foot (10.7 m) maximum vertical intervals on all
supported scaffolds more than 35 feet (10.7 m) high; be specifically
designed for use with the manufactured type of scaffold to be used;
have a minimum rung length of 11 1/2 inches (29 cm); and have
uniformly spaced rungs with a maximum spacing between rungs of 16 3/4
inches, respectively. Proposed paragraph (c)(2) was effectively
identical, except that the maximum interval between rest platforms has
been increased in the final rule from 20 feet to 35 feet and the
maximum rung spacing has been increased from 12 inches to 16 3/4
inches, as discussed below.</p>

<p>Issue 28 in the preamble of the NPRM requested public comment on
whether landing platforms should be required at 35-foot maximum
intervals as required by existing &#167; 1926.451(e)(5), or at 20-foot
maximum intervals as required by proposed &#167; 1926.451(c)(2)(iii).
Three commenters (Exs. 2-13, 2-38, and 2-54) responded in support of
the proposed rule's 20-foot maximum. One commenter (Ex. 2-13) favored
the 20-foot interval because it would "allow a person to catch one's
breath." He added that he could personally appreciate this requirement
as he has climbed ladders for years. In addition, a commenter (Ex.
2-38) stated that "[l]adders should be offset with landings every 20
feet to prevent falling more that 20 feet." Another commenter (Ex.
2-54) responded that the interval in the proposed rule "would make it so
workers were not always huffing and puffing and place less strain on
ladders and how many workers might be on it at the same time."</p>

<p>On the other hand, a commenter (Ex. 2-22) responded that the 35-foot
height was "an acceptable level for the safety of employees and * * *
a practical field requirement." Another commenter (Ex. 2-53) stated
"[l]anding platforms should be required at 35 foot intervals. No need
to change regulations." The SSFI and SIA (Exs. 2-367 and 2-368)
stated that the proposed change to the 20-foot height was too
restrictive and unnecessary. In particular, the SIA (Ex. 2-368) stated
that, since most of the scaffolds which require access from the base
have work platforms less than 28 feet from their base, "the 20 foot
interval requirement would place a rest platform too close to the work
platform and would be unnecess[a]ry." This commenter added that there
are no accident statistics to justify changing the height requirement
from 35 ft. to 20 ft.</p>

<p>The ACCSH (Tr. 191-195, 6-9-87) discussed Issue 28 and recommended
that OSHA adopt the proposed 20-foot requirement. One member stated
"[b]ecause employees are often carrying tools or equipment, the
20-foot requirement is reasonable." OSHA proposed to require landing
platforms at 20-foot maximum intervals in an attempt to be consistent
with existing &#167;&#167; 1910.27 (d)(1)(ii), (d)(2) and (d)(5) of the
general industry standards.</p>

<p>After a careful review of the evidence in the record as a whole,
OSHA finds that requiring landing platforms at 20-foot intervals is
not supported by evidence that such a change is needed for employee
safety. In addition, evidence was submitted to show that many
scaffolds already have work platforms only a few feet higher than the
20-foot level and further that establishing a new height, i.e., 20
feet, would interfere with widely accepted field practice.
Accordingly, the final rule retains the 35-foot maximum intervals for
landing platforms, because it adequately protects the safety of
employees who are accessing scaffolds.</p>

<p>The SSFI (Ex. 2-367) took "strong objection" to proposed paragraph
(c)(2)(vi), which required that there be a maximum spacing between
rungs of 12 inches, because portable, hook-on, and attachable ladders
have been produced for many years with uniformly spaced rungs that do
not meet this requirement. The commenter recommended that OSHA replace
this requirement with a requirement that rungs be uniformly spaced
within each section.</p>

<p>The proposed paragraph was based on existing 1910.26(a)(1)(iii),
which prescribes maximum rung spacing for portable metal ladders used
in general industry. The Agency notes that prior to the proposal there
were no existing OSHA construction regulations addressing hook-on or
attachable ladders, and the proposal was intended to recognize that
these types of ladders are acceptable means of access.</p>

<p>OSHA agrees with the commenter that the rungs should be uniformly
spaced to prevent misstepping. In addition, OSHA believes that the
16 3/4 rung spacing allowed on integral prefabricated scaffold access
frames (end frames) (final rule &#167; 1926.451(e)(6)(v)) should be
applied to hook-on and attachable ladders as well, since these ladders
are commonly used with end frames and this will provide uniform rung
spacing for this application. OSHA has revised the language of the
final rule paragraph (c)(2)(vi) accordingly.</p>

<p>Paragraph (e)(3) of the final rule sets requirements for
stairway-type ladders. In particular, paragraphs (e)(3)(i) through (v)
require that stairway-type ladders be positioned so that the bottom
step is not more than 24 inches (61 cm) above the scaffold supporting
level; be provided with rest platforms at 12 foot (3.7 m) maximum
vertical intervals; have a minimum step width of 16 inches (41 cm)
(except for mobile scaffold stairway-type ladders, which are permitted
to have a minimum step width of 11 1/2 inches); and have
slip-resistant treads on all steps and landings. These provisions are
identical to the corresponding provisions in proposed paragraph
(c)(3), except that an exception has been added in a new final
paragraph (e)(3)(iii) to the minimum rung width in proposed paragraph
(c)(3)(iii). This change has been made to recognize that a minimum
step width of 11 1/2 inches is acceptable for mobile scaffold
stairway-type ladders, as discussed below.</p>

<p>Proposed paragraph (c)(3)(iii), which was based on
1910.29(a)(3)(ii), required a minimum step width of 16 inches. The SIA
(Ex. 2-368) stated that it is necessary to distinguish between
stairway-type ladders and mobile scaffold stairway-type ladders where
the stairway-type ladder is a secondary feature of the platform. The
commenter noted that reduced step width is necessary on this type of
equipment due to space constraints, and pointed out that the reduced
step width is consistent with normal ladder minimum widths. OSHA
agrees, noting that this type of equipment has been demonstrated to be
safe over decades of use, and has revised the final rule accordingly.</p>

<p>Final rule paragraph (e)(3)(iv) requires slip-resistant treads on
all stairs and landings. This rule is based on general industry rule
1910.29(a)(3)(iv), which requires the steps to be fabricated from
slip-resistant treads.</p>

<p>Final rule paragraph (e)(4), which has been added based on the
response to the NPRM and the February 1, 1994 notice of reopening (59
FR 4615), sets requirements for scaffold stairway towers used for
access to scaffolds and other elevated work surfaces. OSHA has
determined that compliance with the provisions described below will
enable employees to use scaffold stairways safely.</p>

<p>The SSFI and the SIA (Exs. 2-367 and 2-368) suggested that OSHA
recognize scaffold stairway/towers as acceptable means of access. They
noted that reference to these types of access units had been omitted
from the proposal even though they are in common use and are a safe
method of obtaining access to scaffold units. Both commenters
recommended that OSHA revise the rule to add requirements for inside
and outside handrails; 19-inch minimum length landing platforms;
19-inch minimum width for stair units; and slip-resistant surfaces for
treads and landings.</p>

<p>In addition, a commenter (Docket S-041, Ex. 3-414) to the Notice of
Proposed Rulemaking for part 1910 subpart D (Walking and Working
Surfaces) stated:</p>

<p>As in the case of guardrails, the stair rails section is based on
the use of this product in permanently installed locations in
buildings or industrial structures. It does not consider stair rails
used in conjunction with scaffold applications.</p>

<p>Scaffold suppliers utilize step units which have been fabricated
specifically to be used as access to scaffold platforms. These step
units are manufactured with hand rails which are sold as a component
of these step units. The OSHA standard should state that these
fabricated step units are acceptable for scaffold access. This will
eliminate the confusion of the compliance officers in attempting to
enforce permanent stair rail standards for scaffold access components.</p>

<p>On February 1, 1994, OSHA reopened the subpart L rulemaking record
(59 FR 4615) to solicit comments and suggestions regarding the
regulation of scaffold stairways, chimney bracket scaffolds and tank
builders' scaffolds. In particular, the Agency requested input on the
provisions suggested by commenters. In addition, although OSHA did not
intend subpart X to apply to stair towers, the Agency was interested
in determining if, in fact, any of the provisions from part 1926,
subpart X or from proposed part 1910, subpart D, would be appropriate
requirements for scaffold stair towers.</p>

<p>The Agency was interested in receiving more input on the need for
specific regulations for scaffold stairways, chimney bracket scaffolds
and tank builders' scaffolds, with special emphasis on fall protection
requirements, including requirements for handrails and guardrail
systems for the unprotected sides and edges of stairway landings. The
provisions of final paragraph (e)(4) are the product of specific
questions raised in the February 1 notice and OSHA's review of the
responses to those questions.</p>

<p>Two commenters (Exs. 43-24 and 43-32) recommended that the Agency
adopt the suggested provisions, although the first of these two
commenters suggested that existing products that do not comply be
accepted. Several other commenters (Exs. 43-6, 43-11, 43-13, 43-14,
43-22, 43-26, and 43-37) supported the adoption of various modified
versions of the suggested provisions. For example, suggested minimum
heights above the tread nose for handrails (or stairrails) ranged from
27 inches (68.6 cm) to 36 inches (91 cm).</p>

<p>A number of commenters (e.g., Exs. 43-4, 43-6, 43-9, 43-10)
contended that for many years scaffold stairways have been designed
and used in the same manner as they currently are, and have always
provided a safe and effective means of access. These commenters
opposed the promulgation of any provisions that would alter the
criteria under which scaffold stairways are currently designed and
used. Most of these commenters also reported that they know of no
accidents that have occurred due to the use of scaffold stairways.</p>

<p>In addition, many commenters (Exs. 43-13, 43-14, 43-24, 43-26,
43-37, and 43-44) specifically opposed applying either the
requirements of subpart X or the general industry standards (1910.25
and 1910.28) to scaffold stairways. These and other commenters
mentioned above indicated that such an application would, in effect,
"outlaw" scaffold stairways since they cannot meet the requirements of
subpart X due to the fact that scaffold stairways must be designed and
constructed to fit within the confines of 5 foot (4.5 m) by 7 foot
(6.3 m) or 5 foot (4.5 m) by 10 foot (9.1 m) scaffold bays. As a
result, according to these commenters, many employers would simply
stop using most scaffold stairways, and would rely instead on other
means of access that are not as safe as scaffold stairways. However,
one commenter (Ex. 43-8) recommended that scaffold stairways covered
by subpart L be consistent with subpart X and the general industry
standards. Another commenter (Ex. 42-33) supported standardizing the
existing stairway standard's requirements, including hand clearances,
end rail projections, type of surface, and guarding of the open sides
of landings.</p>

<p>Scaffold stairways can provide a safe and effective means of access,
and the Agency has no intention of prohibiting the use of all existing
scaffold stairways. However, the Agency does believe that some
provisions governing the construction and use of scaffold stairways
must be included in final subpart L, and that the provisions should be
as consistent as possible with subpart X and the general industry
standards, in order to ensure the safety of the employees who use
scaffold stairways. Accordingly, OSHA has promulgated the provisions
discussed below.</p>

<p>The introductory language of final rule paragraph (e)(4) requires
that these units be positioned so that the bottom step is not more
than 24 inches (61 cm.) above the scaffold supporting level.</p>

<p>Final rule paragraph (e)(4)(i) requires that a stairrail consisting
of a toprail and a midrail be provided on each side of each scaffold
stairway. Furthermore, final paragraph (e)(4)(ii) requires that the
toprail of each stairrail system shall be capable of serving as a
handrail, unless a separate handrail is provided.</p>

<p>Six commenters (Exs. 43-6, 43-11, 43-14, 43-26, 43-37, and 43-44)
indicated that inside and outside handrails should incorporate
midrails. Several commenters (Exs. 43-8, 43-13, 43-14, 43-24, 43-26,
and 43-37) stated that scaffold stairways should incorporate
handrails, stairrails and midrails. One commenter (Ex. 43-45) stated
that scaffold stairways should have stairrail systems with midrails.
Another commenter (Ex. 43-22) stated that inside and outside handrails
should be constructed so that they function as both stairrails and
handrails.</p>

<p>OSHA agrees that handrails, stairrails, and midrails are necessary
for adequate employee protection. However, the Agency also believes
that adequate protection can be provided when toprails of stairrail
systems are capable of serving as adequate handrails. Paragraph
(e)(4)(ii) of the final rule recognizes the capability of toprails to
serve as handrails, but also requires that a separate handrail be
provided when toprails are not capable of serving as a handrail.</p>

<p>Final rule paragraph (e)(4)(iii) requires that handrails, and
toprails that serve as handrails, provide a handhold for employees
grasping them to avoid falling. This provision is identical to
&#167; 1926.1052(c)(9), except for the explicit inclusion of toprails.
Monsanto (Ex. 43-45) stated that handrails should have the shape and
dimension necessary to provide a firm handhold, but provided no
specific shapes or dimensions that would meet that suggested
requirement. OSHA agrees that handrails must be shaped and sized in
such a manner that a proper handhold is provided.</p>

<p>Final rule paragraph (e)(4)(iv) requires that stairrail systems and
handrails be surfaced in a manner that prevents injury to employees
from punctures or lacerations, and to prevent snagging of clothing.
This provision is essentially the same as &#167; 1926.1052(c)(8).
Monsanto (Ex. 43-45) suggested that stairrail systems "be free of
projection and/or puncture/abrasion hazards." OSHA agrees that
handrails should not present such hazards, and the final rule's
language reflects this concern.</p>

<p>Final rule paragraph (e)(4)(v) requires that the ends of stairrail
systems and handrails be constructed in a manner that does not
constitute a projection hazard. This provision is essentially
identical to &#167; 1926.1052(c)(10).</p>

<p>Final rule paragraph (e)(4)(vi) requires that scaffold stairway
handrails, and toprails that are used as handrails, have a minimum
clearance of 3 inches (7.6 cm) between the handrail or toprail and
other objects. This provision is essentially the same as
&#167; 1926.1052(c)(11). As mentioned above, one commenter (Ex. 42-33) stated
that hand clearances for scaffold stairways should be the same as
those for stairways covered by subpart X. OSHA agrees with this
commenter and notes that inadequate hand clearances can render
handrails essentially useless.</p>

<p>Final rule paragraph (e)(4)(vii) requires that stairrails be no less
than 28 inches (71 cm) or more than 37 inches (94 cm) from the upper
surface of the stairrail to the surface of the tread, in line with the
face of the riser at the forward edge of the tread. This provision
differs from the stairrail height requirements of subpart X, which was
never intended to apply to scaffold stairways. Paragraph (e)(4)(vii)
of the final rule is based on the following comments.</p>

<p>One commenter (Ex. 43-11) suggested stairrail height ranging from 27
inches (68.6 cm) to 37 inches (94 cm) vertically above the nose of
each step. Another commenter (Ex. 43-20) recommended a range of 22
inches (56 cm) to 41 inches (104 cm). One other commenter (Ex. 43-45)
recommended stairrail systems "no less than 36 inches (91 cm) high."
However, several other commenters (Exs. 43-6, 43-13, 43-14, 43-26, and
43-37) recommended that stairrails be no less than 28 inches (71 cm)
and no more than 37 inches (94 cm) above the nose of each step.</p>

<p>OSHA notes that &#167; 1926.1052(c)(3) requires that stairrail systems
installed before March 15, 1991, be no less than 30 inches (76.2 cm)
high, and that those installed after March 15, 1991, be no less than
36 inches (91.4 cm) high. The Agency recognizes that this subpart X
requirement may not have been appropriate for stairrails on some
scaffold stairtowers, because the construction of stairtowers differs
significantly from that of stairtowers addressed by subpart X. In
particular, stairtowers are fashioned from scaffold components, must
fit within the framing of scaffold units, and rise more steeply than
other stairways. As a practical matter, the steeper the stairway, the
closer the stairrail will be to the stair surface. Therefore, OSHA has
concluded that it is appropriate and adequately protective for
stairtower stairrails to be at least 28 inches, rather than 30 inches,
high. Accordingly, a requirement that employers retrofit scaffold
stairtowers with 30-inch high stairrails, or that employers phase in
30-inch high stairrails at some future time, would be unreasonable.
OSHA believes that existing equipment and designs can comply with the
28-inch height requirement and should continue to be allowed in use.
In addition, OSHA observes that stairtowers with 28-inch high
stairrails are safer than ladders and that requirements to retrofit or
redesign stairtowers could lead cost-averse employers to use ladders
instead of stairtowers.</p>

<p>Final rule paragraph (e)(4)(viii) requires that scaffold stairways
be provided with landing platforms that are at least 18 inches wide
and at least 18 inches (45.7 cm) long at each level. This provision
provides adequate protection for employees without impeding the use of
most scaffold stairways now in use.</p>

<p>Several commenters (Exs. 43-6, 43-13, 43-20, 43-22, 43-24, and
43-33) who addressed the issue of landing platforms supported
requiring landing platforms at least 19 inches (48.3 cm) wide at every
level. Three other commenters (Exs. 43-14, 43-26, and 43-37)
recommended that landing platforms at least 18 inches (45.7 cm) wide
be required at each level. Four of those commenters (Exs. 43-6, 43-14,
43-26, and 43-37) also suggested adding to such a provision the
alternative of providing a platform at least 30 inches long (76.2 cm)
in the direction of travel at "every 14 feet (4.5 m) maximum of stair
elevation." Those commenters stated that this would "allow the
continued use of frame scaffolds spaced 6 1/2 feet (2.1 m) vertically
and system scaffolds which are based upon 7 foot (2.25 m) maximum
vertical bearer spacing."</p>

<p>In addition, two commenters (Exs. 43-11 and 43-45) recommended a
minimum landing width of 24 inches (61 cm). Another commenter (Ex.
43-22) recommended that "landing platforms extend the entire width of
the scaffold instead of only one-half the width as they do now."</p>

<p>OSHA believes that employee safety mandates that a landing meeting
the requirements and specifications of this provision must be provided
on stairtowers. The Agency also believes that landings must be as wide
as the stairway itself (at least 18 inches (45.8 cm)) in the direction
in which the stairway is measured and at least 18 inches long in the
other direction as well.</p>

<p>Final rule paragraph (e)(4)(ix) requires that each scaffold stairway
be at least 18 inches (45.8 cm) wide between stairrails. Several
commenters (Exs. 43-6, 43-8, 43-11, 43-13, 43-14, 43-20, 43-22, 43-24,
43-26, 43-32, and 43-37) supported a minimum stair width of 19 inches
(48.2 cm). However, the record provides no basis for OSHA to require
that stairs be wider than their landings. In addition, 18 inches is
the minimum width allowed for normal scaffolds.</p>

<p>Final rule paragraph (e)(4)(x) requires that treads and landings
have slip-resistant surfaces. This provision is consistent with
existing &#167; 1926.1052(a)(7), which requires that slippery conditions
on stairways be eliminated before the stairways are used to reach
other levels.</p>

<p>Several commenters (Exs. 43-6, 43-8, 43-11, 43-13, 43-14, 43-20,
43-22, 43-24, 43-26, 43-32, 43-37, and 43-44) supported a requirement
that treads and landings have slip-resistant surfaces. The Agency
agrees with those commenters, and notes that scaffolds are often used
in conditions that can create slippery surfaces.</p>

<p>Final rule paragraph (e)(4)(xi) requires that scaffold stairways be
installed between 40 degrees and 60 degrees from the horizontal.
Existing &#167; 1926.1052(a)(2) requires that stairs be installed at
between 30 degrees and 50 degrees from horizontal. OSHA believes that
a minimum and a maximum angle must be specified in order to adequately
protect employees from fall hazards. However, the Agency believes that
compliance with existing &#167; 1926.1052(a)(2) will not be feasible for
stairways regulated under subpart L, because scaffold stairways must
fit into the confines of scaffold framing.</p>

<p>Six commenters (Exs. 43-6, 43-13, 43-14, 43-24, 43-37, and 43-44)
opposed the specification of a minimum and a maximum angle from the
horizontal for scaffold stairways. However, five of these commenters
(Exs. 43-6, 43-13, 43-14, 43-37, and 43-44) provided suggested values
in case OSHA should decide to specify a minimum and a maximum angle
anyway. Four (Exs. 43-6, 43-13, 43-14, and 43-37) of those commenters
suggested a minimum angle of 40 degrees and a maximum angle of 55
degrees since the stairs must fit into 7-foot (2.25 m) or 10-foot (3.2
m) bays with landing platforms. The fifth commenter (Ex. 43-44)
recommended angles of 35 degrees and 55 degrees. Three (Exs. 43-6,
43-14, and 43-37) of those commenters stated that once the angle
approaches 80 degrees, the stairway becomes a ship's ladder. Another
commenter (Ex. 43-11) agreed with that concept but placed the angle at
60 degrees.</p>

<p>One commenter (Ex. 43-11) recommended that the limits be set at 40
degrees and 80 degrees, while another commenter (Ex. 43-22)
recommended a maximum angle of 50 degrees but provided no minimum
value. Another commenter (Ex. 43-32) recommended a minimum angle of 30
degrees and a maximum angle of 50 degrees in order to make subpart L
consistent with subpart X.</p>

<p>OSHA has determined that scaffold stairways installed in the range
of 40 degrees to 60 degrees from the horizontal will provide safe
employee access and will still be capable of fitting into the confines
of the scaffold frames. Paragraph (e)(4)(xi) of the final rule
reflects this determination.</p>

<p>Final rule paragraph (e)(4)(xii) requires that guardrails meeting
the requirements of &#167; 1926.451(g)(4) be provided on the open sides and
ends of each landing.</p>

<p>OSHA asked in the February 1, 1994 reopening notice if guardrails
installed on scaffold stairways should comply with both subpart M
(fall protection) and this subpart L.</p>

<p>One commenter (Ex. 43-8) recommended that such guardrails meet the
requirements of subpart M for the sake of consistency. Another
commenter (Ex. 43-13) suggested that only the provisions of subpart L
should apply. Two other commenters (Exs. 43-14 and 43-37) opposed any
requirement for guardrails on landing platforms, unless work was to be
performed from them, on the grounds that "(n)o hazard or accident data
supports this requirement."</p>

<p>OSHA believes that employees on landing platforms must be adequately
protected from fall hazards while on a landing whether they are
working from the landing or not. However, the Agency recognizes that
providing guardrails that meet the requirements of subpart M would be
inappropriate for use on scaffolds and scaffold stair towers because
they are built to other requirements. Instead, OSHA has determined
that scaffold guardrails, as required in subpart L, are appropriate
because employers build scaffold stairways using scaffold components,
which are designed for 36 to 45-inch high guardrails. In addition, the
Agency notes that scaffold stairways have been in use for many years
and that guardrail systems that comply with subpart L have provided
adequate safety for employees using these stairways. Accordingly,
final rule paragraph (a)(4)(xii) requires guardrails between 36 and 45
inches in height be used on the open sides and ends of each landing.</p>

<p>Final paragraph (e)(4)(xiii) requires riser heights within each
flight of scaffold stairs to be uniform within 1/4 inch.</p>

<p>Four commenters (Exs. 43-8, 43-32, 43-44, and 43-45) recommended
that OSHA require uniform riser height for all steps within each
flight of stairs. Six commenters (Exs. 43-6, 43-11, 43-13, 43-14,
43-24, and 43-37) responded that a uniform riser height within 1/4
inch (0.6 cm) is possible to achieve, except for the first step and
the last step where variations in decking thickness and the use of
screw jacks at ground level make achieving this degree of uniformity
difficult. OSHA believes that a uniform riser height within 1/4 inch
(0.6 cm) for all steps in each flight of stairs is necessary in order
to minimize the possibility that employees will slip, trip, and fall
while they are on the stairs.</p>

<p>OSHA recognizes that there are situations where the level of the
ground or of the structure to which the stair tower is connected will
cause the spacing of the top or bottom step of the stairway system to
deviate from uniformity with the other steps by more than 1/4 inch.
The Agency has determined that such deviation will not compromise
employee safety, so long as the stair tower otherwise complies with
the requirements of paragraph (e)(4).</p>

<p>Final paragraph (e)(4)(xiv) requires that tread depth be uniform,
within 1/4 inch, for each flight of stairs. This provision is
consistent with existing &#167; 1926.1052(a)(3), which requires tread depth
uniformity in other types of stairs used in construction.</p>

<p>Monsanto (Ex. 43-45) supported requirements providing for uniformity
of riser height and tread depth within each flight of stairs. OSHA
believes that tread depth uniformity, within 1/4 inch, as required
in existing subpart X, is also appropriate for scaffold stairways.
Uniform tread depth reduces the possibility that employees will slip
and fall due to uneven footing.</p>

<p>Final rule paragraph (e)(5) sets requirements for ramps and walkways
used to access scaffolds. Final rule paragraph (e)(5)(i) provides that
ramps and walkways six (6) feet (1.8 m) or more above lower levels
shall be provided with guardrail systems in accordance with the
provisions of part 1926, subpart M--Fall Protection. In addition,
final rule paragraph (e)(5)(ii) provides that ramps and walkways shall
not exceed a slope of one (1) vertical to three (3) horizontal (20
degrees above the horizontal). Finally, final rule paragraph
(e)(5)(iii) also requires that if the slope of a ramp or walkway is
steeper than one (1) vertical in eight (8) horizontal, the ramp or
walkway must have cleats not more than fourteen (14) inches (35 cm)
apart which are securely fastened to the planking to provide secure
footing.</p>

<p>The corresponding proposed paragraph simply required that ramps and
runways be provided with guardrails in accordance with the provisions
of proposed &#167;&#167; 1926.501 and 1926.502 (Subpart M). As discussed above in
relation to the final rule term "ramps", OSHA has replaced the term
"runways" with the term "walkways", since the term "walkway", unlike
the term "runways", is defined in this final rule.</p>

<p>A commenter (Exs. 2-37 and 2-103) stated "[r]amps and walkways are
used extensively * * * as a means of egress to an elevated surface.
Ramps are also used for material handling equipment. Since no standard
angle of elevation is addressed, an extreme angle of elevation and
slippery surfaces would result in fall-type accidents and muscle
strains." The commenter also stated that inadequately guarded walkways
pose fall hazards. The commenter recommended language that would
address the angle of elevation of ramps and would require cleats on
ramps with slopes steeper than one (1) vertical in eight (8)
horizontal to provide a safe foothold.</p>

<p>OSHA recognizes the need to indicate clearly what would be an
appropriate slope for ramps used as access to scaffolds and has
incorporated this language into the final rule as paragraphs
&#167;&#167; 1926.451(e)(5)(ii) and (iii).</p>

<p>The Agency notes that final rule &#167; 1926.451(f)(8) requires that
employees be prohibited from working on scaffolds covered with snow,
ice, or other slippery material except as necessary for removal of
such material. OSHA considers scaffold access ramps and walkways to be
part of the scaffold and will also apply &#167; 1926.451(f)(8) to those ramps
and walkways.</p>

<p>Final rule paragraph (e)(6) sets requirements for integral
prefabricated scaffold access frames. Final rule paragraph (e)(6)(i)
provides that such frames shall be specifically designed and
constructed for use as ladder rungs. Also, final rule paragraph
(e)(6)(ii) requires that the frames have a rung length of at least 8
inches (20 cm). Final rule paragraph (e)(6)(iii) prescribes that rungs
less than 11 1/2 inches in length shall be used for access only and
not as work platforms unless fall protection, or a positioning device,
is used. In addition, final rule paragraphs (e)(6)(iv) through (vi)
require that integral prefabricated scaffold access frames be
uniformly spaced within each frame section; provided with rest
platforms at 35 foot (10.7 m) maximum vertical intervals on all
supported scaffolds more than 35 feet (10.7 m) high; and have a
maximum spacing between rungs of 16 3/4 inches (43 cm), respectively.
In addition, final rule paragraph (e)(6)(vi) provides that non-uniform
rung spacing caused by joining end frames together is allowed,
provided the resulting spacing does not exceed 16 3/4 inches (43 cm).
These provisions are similar to those in proposed paragraph (c)(5).</p>

<p>Regarding the proposed introductory text, the SSFI (Ex. 2-367)
recommended using the words "access frames" instead of the word
"rung." OSHA agrees that the suggested language more clearly states
the Agency's regulatory intent and has revised this paragraph in the
final rule accordingly.</p>

<p>Paragraph (e)(6)(i) of the final rule is identical to proposed
paragraph (c)(5)(i) except that the Agency has editorially revised the
provision to express OSHA's intent more clearly. OSHA recognizes that
the proposed language could have been misinterpreted to require only
that the access frames be designed as scaffold rungs, with no
requirement for them to be constructed in accordance with that design.
OSHA anticipates that these rungs will be designed and constructed
through consultation between the manufacturer and the end user in
order to satisfy the pertinent requirements of the final rule.</p>

<p>Final rule paragraph (e)(6)(ii) requires a minimum rung length of
eight inches. In addition, final rule paragraph (e)(6)(iii) prohibits
the use of rungs less than 11 1/2 inches long as work platforms,
unless affected employees are using personal fall arrest systems or
positioning devices that comply with &#167; 1926.502 (paragraphs (d) and
(e), respectively). These two provisions evolved from proposed
(c)(5)(ii), which required a minimum rung length of 11 1/2 inches (29
cm). Morgen Manufacturing Company (Ex. 2-303) commented that scaffolds
with integral prefabricated scaffold rungs which are only eight inches
long also "provide safe access [to a work platform] equivalent to that
of a ladder." Further, the commenter stated that the 8-inch rungs
"provide surer footing and a better climb than does or can a ladder."</p>

<p>Another commenter (Ex. 2-23) stated that all ladders should have a
minimum rung length of 12 inches in order to avoid confusion.</p>

<p>To evaluate this point, Issue L-6 of the hearing notice asked if
OSHA should revise proposed &#167; 1926.451(c)(5)(ii) to allow rung lengths
less than 11 1/2 inches where the rungs were used for access only. The
SIA (Ex. 10; Tr. 3/22/88, p. 159) supported the 11 1/2-inch width
requirement explaining "[i]t's our understanding that the 11 1/2-inch
width was required * * * to allow the workman to stand on a rung with
both feet * * * [A]n 8-inch rung would not be wide enough." Similarly,
the SSFI (Ex. 5a-19) commented that its members would not support
reducing "the minimum rung width from 11 1/2 inches to * * * eight
inches." They added that practical usage indicates that 11 1/2 - inch
ladder rungs are appropriate.</p>

<p>Bristol Steel and Iron Works, Inc. (Ex. 13) stated that scaffold
rungs that were less than 11 1/2 inches long were acceptable "if they
provide safe access equivalent to that of a ladder."</p>

<p>Morgen Scaffold's notice of intention to appear at the hearing (Ex.
5a-10), testimony at the hearing (Tr. 20-32, 3-22-88), and
post-hearing comments (Ex. 15), stated that OSHA should either revise
the proposed rule as provided in Issue L-6 or grandfather the existing
Morgen scaffolds to permit continued use of the 8-inch integral rung
system.</p>

<p>Morgen contended (Ex. 5a-10, p. 2) that its scaffold tower's
integral rungs provide a safe and stable footing and handhold for
workers using the towers for access to connection points for
installation and removal of bracing and accessories. Morgen's
post-hearing comments (Ex. 15, p. 3) further contended that the Morgen
integral-rung system was safer than those requiring the use of a
ladder and offered the following rationale:</p>

<p>Morgen feels that the tower provides a more secure area from which
to install and remove the bracing and accessories than would a ladder.
When using a ladder with any type of scaffolding, the worker is
generally further from the connection point and must shift his weight
off the ladder to install bracing.</p>

<p>At the hearings, Morgen acknowledged that at no time are workers
able to put both feet on the same eight-inch rung (Tr. 3/22/88, p.
25). However, Morgen also stated that "the size of the Morgen tower
allows the worker to hug the tower, which is more secure than merely
standing with both feet on one rung" (Ex. 15, p. 3). Morgen also
asserted that worker activities, rather than an arbitrary dimension,
should be the main consideration (Ex. 15, p. 7). OSHA believes that
the 11 1/2-inch dimension is not an "arbitrary dimension", because
this rung size is generally recognized as necessary to provide workers
with level footing of sufficient size to enable them to stand on both
feet, thus avoiding the need to balance on one foot.</p>

<p>Morgen recognized (Tr. 28) that it is appropriate for employees to
use personal fall arrest or positioning devices while transporting or
installing scaffold components. Morgen recommends that personal fall
arrest systems be used to protect employees when tower inserts are
being added "because the worker must keep both hands free to guide the
inserts into position" (Ex. 15, p. 6). These same systems can be
easily used during other scaffold erection and disassembly procedures.</p>

<p>Morgen also stated (Ex. 15, p. 8) as follows:</p>

<p>Morgen has no objection to the institution of an industry wide
requirement for the use of body belts while installing bracing, stiff
arms, accessories and planking from integral ladder rungs. Morgen's
objection to the language currently proposed is that it singles out
Morgen and implies that the Morgen design is not safe. Morgen objects
to that characterization and feels that its scaffold is among the
safest in the industry. The characteristics which OSHA wants to
address, concerning the safe installation of scaffold elements while
in the air, are not unique to the Morgen scaffold and do not depend
upon a specified rung length.</p>

<p>OSHA agrees that the concerns addressed are not unique to Morgen
scaffolds. However, OSHA disagrees with the position that there is no
practical difference between an eight-inch rung where an employee can
stand only on one foot and must hug the tower to maintain balance and
an 11 1/2-inch rung where both feet may be placed on a single rung.
OSHA also notes that &#167; 1926.1053(a)(4)(ii) specifies 11 1/2 inches as
the appropriate minimum rung length on portable ladders.</p>

<p>After a careful evaluation of all the comments received, OSHA has
determined that rungs which are at least 8 inches long but less than
11 1/2 inches long can be used safely for scaffold access, because
while climbing or descending the employee will normally have only one
foot on a rung at any given time and the 8 inch rungs will accommodate
this. However, employees who are assigned to use such rungs as work
platforms must be provided additional protection by the use of
personal fall arrest systems, or by positioning device systems, which
comply with &#167; 1926.502. This additional safeguard will ensure that
employees required to work from rungs less than 11 1/2 inches in
width will be adequately protected from falling. This provision of the
final rule has been revised accordingly.</p>

<p>Final rule paragraph (e)(6)(iv) is identical to proposed paragraph
(c)(5)(iii), except that the term "frame" has been revised in the
final rule to read "each frame section," so that the provision clearly
addresses situations where end frames are joined together, producing
non-uniform spacing in the area where the frames are joined. OSHA was
concerned that the proposal could have been misinterpreted to require
absolutely uniform spacing for the entire height of the scaffold. That
was not OSHA's intent, as evidenced by proposed (c)(5)(v) (final rule
paragraph (e)(6)(vi)) which prescribed maximum spacing of rungs, but
allowed for non-uniform spacing caused by the joining of end frames.</p>

<p>Proposed paragraph (c)(5)(iv) differed from final rule paragraph
(e)(6)(v) in that the proposal required rest platforms at 20-foot
intervals instead of 35-foot intervals. This revision is based on the
response to Issue 28, as discussed above in relation to final rule
paragraph (e)(2)(iii).</p>

<p>Proposed paragraph (c)(5)(v) differed from final rule paragraph
(e)(6)(vi) in that the proposal required 16 1/2-inch instead of 16
3/4-inch maximum spacing of rungs. This change reflects input from the
SSFI (Ex. 2-367), which informed OSHA that 16 3/4 inches is the
current industry guideline for rung spacing. In proposing 16 1/2
inches OSHA intended to recognize the large number of frames already
in existence without requiring a significant program of frame
modification. Therefore, based on the comment indicating that 16 3/4
inches, not 16 1/2 inches, is the prevalent spacing, and because the
additional one-fourth-inch spacing is not believed to be significant,
OSHA has modified the final rule to recognize the 16 3/4 inch spacing
limit.</p>

<p>Final rule paragraph (e)(7) provides that all steps and rungs of all
ladder and stairway type access shall line up vertically with each
other between rest platforms. Proposed paragraph (c)(6) was identical
except that the final rule has added the phrase "of all ladder and
stairway type access" so that the final rule more clearly expresses
the Agency's intent.</p>

<p>Final rule paragraph (e)(8) provides that direct access to or from
another surface shall be allowed only when the pertinent surfaces are
not more than 14 inches (36 cm) apart horizontally and not more than
24 inches (61 cm) apart vertically. It is identical to proposed
paragraph (c)(7) except for the addition of the phrase "to or from
another surface" and some other minor editorial changes. The 14-inch
dimension was chosen to be consistent with proposed &#167; 1926.451(b)(4)
(promulgated as final rule &#167; 1926.451(b)(3)).</p>

<p>The 24-inch dimension is consistent with final rule paragraphs
(e)(1), (e)(2)(ii) and (e)(3)(i), as discussed above.</p>

<p>Paragraph (e)(9) of the final rule sets access requirements for
employees erecting or dismantling supported scaffolds. The
introductory language of paragraph (e)(9) requires employers to comply
with final paragraphs (e)(9)(i)-(iv) starting on September 2, 1997.
OSHA has delayed implementation of this paragraph (as well as
paragraph (g)(2)) so that affected employers have sufficient time to
develop and implement the necessary measures. In addition, the delayed
implementation allows time for OSHA to complete work on non-mandatory
Appendix B, discussed below, which will provide examples of
considerations that employers complying with paragraphs (e)(9) and
(g)(2) would take into account. Paragraph (e)(9)(i) provides that the
means of access for erectors or dismantlers shall be determined by a
competent person, based on specific site conditions and the type of
scaffold being erected. As discussed in relation to the introductory
text of final rule paragraph (e), while the Agency originally proposed
to exempt erectors and dismantlers working on supported scaffolds from
requirements for safe access, careful review of the record has led
OSHA to the conclusion that a competent person is the appropriate
individual to decide what the appropriate means of access for scaffold
erectors and dismantlers is on any particular job, based on specific
site conditions.</p>

<p>As discussed below in relation to final rule &#167; 1926.451(f)(7)
(effectively identical to existing rule &#167; 1926.451(a)(3) and proposed
rule paragraph (d)(7)), employers are required to have the erection,
dismantling or alteration of a scaffold conducted under the
supervision and direction of a competent person who is qualified in
the pertinent subject matter.</p>

<p>OSHA is developing non-mandatory Appendix B, which will be added at
a later date, to provide examples of criteria for the competent person
to consider when evaluating the feasibility and safety of the options
for providing safe access. This final rule reserves Appendix B to
enable OSHA to provide guidance on the feasibility of providing safe
access and fall protection during erection and dismantling. Once that
language has been added, access provided in accordance with
non-mandatory Appendix B will be considered to meet the requirements
of this provision.</p>

<p>Paragraph (e)(9)(ii) of the final rule requires that hook-on or
attachable ladders be installed as soon as practical after the
scaffold erection has progressed to the point permitting their
installation and use. OSHA has included this provision because the
rulemaking record (Exs. 34-9, 34-10, 34-12, and 34-17) indicates that
sectional ladders can be used for access once adequate support is
available.</p>

<p>Paragraph (e)(9)(iii) of the final rule recognizes that the end
frames of tubular welded frame scaffolds that meet certain
requirements can be safely used as a means of access for scaffold
erectors and dismantlers. These requirements are based on section
1637(n)(2)(C) of the California code, as suggested by one of the
commenters (Ex. 2-23).</p>

<p>Paragraph (e)(9)(iv) of the final rule provides that crossbracing is
not an acceptable means of access on tubular welded frame scaffolds,
because crossbraces are designed to provide diagonal stability to the
scaffold and are not designed to withstand the forces that could be
applied by employees climbing up and down on them. This provision is
consistent with ANSI A10.8, section 4.18, and with the general
prohibition in final rule paragraph (e)(1), discussed above. This
requirement is being repeated here to ensure that the users are aware
that the prohibition applies to scaffold erectors and dismantlers as
well as to scaffold users. The Agency invites interested parties to
provide OSHA with suggestions and information regarding appropriate
guidance for the competent person.</p>

<p><b class="ITALICS">Paragraph 1926.451(f) Use</b></p>

<p>Paragraph (f) of the final rule addresses safe work practices for
the use of scaffolds and the activities which take place on scaffolds.</p>

<p>Paragraph (f)(1) of the final rule provides that scaffolds and
scaffold components shall not be loaded in excess of their maximum
intended loads or rated capacities, whichever is less. This is
identical to proposed paragraph (d)(1), except for the clarifying
phrase "whichever is less." This provision clarifies and consolidates
existing &#167;&#167; 1926.451(h)(1), (i)(8), (j)(1), (s)(6), (t)(4), (w)(1),
(x)(3) and (y)(1)(iii). This final rule also complements
&#167; 1926.451(a)(1), which requires that scaffolds be capable of supporting
four times the maximum intended load without failure. Compliance with
this rule ensures that the scaffold's capacity is not exceeded.</p>

<p>A commenter (Ex. 2-64) suggested deleting the term "maximum intended
load." OSHA has not done so because, as discussed above in relation to
the definition of this term, the Agency believes it is appropriate to
take into account the "expected" burden as well as the burden a
scaffold "can" support without failure.</p>

<p>Paragraph (f)(2) of the final rule prohibits the use of shore or
lean-to scaffolds. The final rule is identical to proposed paragraph
(d)(2), which was based on existing &#167; 1926.451(a)(20). Such scaffolds
are not properly designed nor properly constructed, and pose a serious
threat to anyone working on them. The two commenters (Exs. 2-23 and
2-308) who addressed this provision simply agreed with the continued
prohibition of shore and lean-to scaffolds.</p>

<p>Paragraph (f)(3) of the final rule requires that scaffolds and
scaffold components be inspected for visible defects by a competent
person prior to each work shift and after any occurrence which could
affect a scaffold's structural integrity. Final rule paragraph (f)(3)
is identical to proposed paragraph (d)(3), which was based on existing
&#167;&#167; 1926.45(i)(7) and (k)(5). Those existing provisions require
inspections of certain types of suspension scaffolds. Given the
importance of detecting defects in scaffolds and scaffold components,
OSHA concludes that all scaffolds need to be inspected at the times
specified in the final rule.</p>

<p>Issue 16 requested comment on the proposed frequency of scaffold
inspections for visible defects "prior to each workshift." Two
commenters (Exs. 2-13 and 2-69) stated that only certain types of
scaffolds can be fully or partially inspected prior to each workshift.
Those commenters agreed that two-point suspension scaffolds can be
fully inspected, but they indicated that such an inspection could not
be done for "tubular welded frame scaffold covering a multi-story
building." One of them (Ex. 2-13) added that proposed &#167; 1926.451(d)(3)
should specify the types of scaffolds to be completely inspected prior
to each workshift and offered suspension and small supported scaffolds
as examples. The other (Ex. 2-69) stated that inspecting a multi-story
scaffold system could take the majority of the work shift.</p>

<p>OSHA acknowledges that the amount of time needed to perform visual
inspection may depend on the type and size of the scaffold being
inspected. However, OSHA believes that it is appropriate for the
proposed inspection requirement to cover all types of scaffolds,
because any scaffold (or scaffold component) can have or develop
defects which would pose hazards for employees if allowed to remain in
service without being inspected. In addition, OSHA believes that the
time to conduct a careful inspection for "visible defects" will
involve a reasonable amount of time when considered in relation to the
scale of the work in question.</p>

<p>Another commenter (Ex. 2-64) stated that suspended scaffolds ("and
associated equipment") should be inspected according to the
manufacturer's recommendations. In addition, this commenter provided a
copy of the company's recommended inspection schedule for particular
suspension scaffold components. This commenter also stated that
"improper maintenance was the most frequent cause of product
incidents."</p>

<p>One commenter (Ex. 2-43) stated that the "[i]nspection procedures
for swing stages are adequate" but that "[w]eekly or monthly
inspections on rolling or stationary scaffolds should be mandated."
Another commenter (Ex. 2-31) responded that the daily inspections
(prior to each workshift) were "appropriate for the pumpjack
scaffolding user."</p>

<p>Eight commenters (Exs. 2-15, 2-22, 2-53, 2-70, 2-367, 2-368, 2-407,
and 2-465) supported specifying scaffold inspection frequency, without
regard to the type or size scaffold inspected. In particular, a
commenter (Ex. 2-22) stated that the inspection frequency should be no
more "than once per day or after an occurrence." Another commenter
(Ex. 2-53) was of the opinion that scaffolds and scaffold components
should be inspected for visible defects prior to each use. The ACCSH
recommended that scaffold inspection should take place prior to use,
and added that a competent person should handle the inspection (Tr.
6/9/87, 136-138).</p>

<p>The SIA (Ex. 2-368) also supported having a competent person perform
the inspection but stated that a full inspection was not "feasible
every time a worker gets on a scaffold." The commenter stated that
"[i]nspection is a critical factor in accident prevention" and agreed
that the daily inspection, prior to each workshift, was appropriate.
The SIA also discussed specific occurrences that might alter the
condition of a scaffold, explaining that these "would include
unexplained shifting, movement, or malfunction of equipment where
[the] scaffold is a mechanical device."</p>

<p>In addition, the SSFI (Ex. 2-367) indicated that the recommendation
for daily inspection coincided with the proposed ANSI A10.8
requirements for inspection. They added that a scaffold should be
inspected when it "has been altered, either by accident or design."</p>

<p>The BCMALU (Ex. 2-54) supported the inspection of scaffolds and
their components but did not indicate a preferred interval for such
inspections.</p>

<p>After a careful review of these comments, OSHA has determined that
inspections conducted by a competent person before each shift and
after any occurrence that would affect the scaffold's integrity will
adequately protect employees working on scaffolds and ensure that
defects are detected in a timely fashion. Given the variety of
scaffolds and situations that arise regarding their use, the Agency
believes that specifying the inspection frequency would unnecessarily
limit employers' flexibility.</p>

<p>One commenter (Ex. 2-308) stated that all inspection results should
be in writing and be signed by a "competent person." This commenter
pointed out that the duration of a "workshift" needed to be defined if
inspection was required before each shift. OSHA believes that such
documentation is unnecessarily burdensome, especially in light of
&#167; 1926.451(f)(4) of this final rule, which requires immediate repair,
replacement, bracing, or removal from service of any scaffold part
that does not meet the strength requirements of &#167; 1926.451 (a) or (g).
In addition, the Agency recognizes that the length of workshifts
varies and has determined that the protection afforded by this
provision is needed whatever the length of the workshift. Accordingly,
OSHA has not added the suggested revisions.</p>

<p>Several commenters (Exs. 2-37, 2-38, and 2-103) stated that there
was a need to define "competent person." OSHA notes that a general
definition of this individual that applies to all construction work
already exists in &#167; 1926.32. Although the definition of competent person
in that section applies to all construction work, OSHA believes that
it is reasonable to repeat this definition of "competent person" in
the final rule, as a matter of convenience for the user. However, the
Agency notes that the criteria for a "competent person" depend on the
situation in which the competent person is working. For example, a
"competent person" for the purposes of this provision must have had
specific training in and be knowledgeable about the structural
integrity of scaffolds and the degree of maintenance needed to
maintain them. The competent person must also be able to evaluate the
effects of occurrences such as a dropped load, or a truck backing into
a support leg that could damage a scaffold. In addition, the competent
person must be knowledgeable about the requirements of this standard.
A competent person must have training or knowledge in these areas in
order to identify and correct hazards encountered in scaffold work.</p>

<p>Final rule paragraph (f)(4) requires that any part of a scaffold
whose strength has been reduced to less than that required by
&#167; 1926.451(a) shall be immediately repaired or replaced, braced to meet
those provisions, where appropriate, or be removed from service until
repaired. This paragraph applies whenever a scaffold component, for
any reason, lacks the required strength. In particular, under this
provision employers must follow through to address problems identified
pursuant to paragraph (f)(3) of this section. Proposed paragraph
(d)(4) was effectively identical to final rule paragraph (f)(4),
except that the proposal required action only when a competent person
determined that the strength of a part had been compromised, and
provided only for bracing of a part or its removal from service. This
provision of the final rule thus clarifies and consolidates existing
&#167;&#167; 1926.451 (a)(8) and (o)(6). The proposed paragraph also recognized
bracing as an acceptable means of compliance because OSHA foresaw
circumstances where the removal of a damaged component could be
extremely difficult or hazardous due to its location. However,
provision for replacement of a damaged component was inadvertently
left out of the proposal. OSHA has included it in the final rule so
that the text clearly expresses the Agency's intent.</p>

<p>Final rule paragraph (f)(5) provides that scaffolds shall not be
moved horizontally while employees are on them, except that mobile
scaffolds may be moved if the provisions of &#167; 1926.452(w) for mobile
scaffolds are followed, and then only if they have been designed by a
registered professional engineer specifically for such movement. Final
rule paragraph (f)(5) is very similar to the proposed paragraph (d)(5)
except that "laterally" has been changed to "horizontally" for the
sake of clarity. In addition, the proposed exception did not include
scaffolds designed by registered professional engineers specifically
for such movement. The proposed rule was intended to consolidate and
reconcile existing &#167; 1926.451(a)(3) (any scaffold movement must be
conducted under the supervision of a competent person), (e)(6)-(8)
(criteria for moving mobile scaffolds) and (p)(1) (needle beam
scaffolds shall not be moved while in use).</p>

<p>Two commenters (Exs. 2-13 and 2-367) suggested that the Agency
prohibit, in all instances, the moving of mobile scaffolds when
employees are on them, but gave no specific rationale for their
comments. The Agency is not acting on these suggestions because it has
determined that the provisions of final rule paragraph &#167; 1926.451(f)(7)
requiring a competent person to supervise and direct any movement of a
scaffold, and the requirements of &#167; 1926.452(w), which specifically
address the movement of mobile scaffolds, will provide adequate
protection for employees. In addition, the Agency believes that making
employees climb up and down the scaffold every time it is moved could
actually expose them to greater risk of falling than remaining on a
scaffold that is being moved under the direction of a competent person
in accordance with the requirements of &#167; 1926.452(w).</p>

<p>The SIA (Ex. 2-368) recommended that OSHA add another exception for
some suspension scaffolds which are designed to be moved horizontally
while occupied. The commenter cited as an example scaffolds used for
the construction of bridges and other similar steel structures where
it is impossible to move the scaffold at the ground level. The final
rule allows this type of scaffold to be moved horizontally if the
scaffold has been designed for such movement by a registered
professional engineer.</p>

<p>Paragraph (f)(6) of the final rule addresses the use of scaffolds
near exposed and energized power lines. In particular, this paragraph
requires employers to maintain clearance between power lines and
scaffolds, including any conductive materials on the scaffold. The
minimum clearance for all uninsulated lines and for insulated lines of
more than 300 volts is 10 feet. The minimum clearance for insulated
lines of less than 300 volts is 3 feet. In addition, final rule
paragraph (f)(6)(i) provides that scaffolds and materials may be
closer to power lines than specified above only where necessary to do
the work, and only after the utility company or electrical system
operator has been notified of the need to work closer and the utility
company or electrical system operator has deenergized the lines,
relocated the lines, or installed protective coverings to prevent
accidental contact with the lines.</p>

<p>The final rule provisions in paragraph (f)(6) are very similar to
those in proposed paragraph (d)(6), except that the final rule
addresses materials used on scaffolds; provides an exception for
situations where the employer has contacted the utility company to
have power lines de-energized, relocated or covered to prevent
accidental contact; and sets three feet, rather than two feet, as the
minimum clearance between scaffolds and insulated lines of less than
300 volts. OSHA has also editorially revised this provision for the
sake of clarity.</p>

<p>The first two changes noted above were made based on input received
in response to Issue L-5 of the hearing notice (53 FR 2051). First,
the ACCSH (Tr. 6/9/87, p. 204) suggested that OSHA revise proposed
&#167; 1926.451(d)(6) to reflect concern that conductive material handled on
a scaffold might contact exposed and energized lines even if the
scaffold itself did not. To this end, the ACCSH recommended that the
introductory language of proposed &#167; 1926.451(d)(6) read as follows:</p>

<p>Scaffolds shall not be erected, used or moved in such a way that
they or any conductive material handled on them can come closer to
exposed and energized power lines than as follows: * * * .</p>

<p>The Edison Electric Institute (EEI) testified (Tr. 190, 3-22-88) in
favor of the suggested language, stating "[w]e also support your
contention that any conductive extension or persons moving on that
scaffold, the platform, should also comply [with] 10 feet."</p>

<p>Second, a commenter (Ex. 2-103) suggested that the Agency require
employers to notify the power company when scaffolds are to be erected
near energized power lines and request that the power company
de-energize the line or provide protective covering to prevent
accidental contact.</p>

<p>In Hearing Notice Issue L-5, OSHA indicated its expectation that
adding the suggested language would provide primary employee
protection from electrical shock hazards. The Agency further indicated
that proposed paragraph (d)(6) would apply if the affected employer
could not obtain assurances from the utility company that the lines
had been de-energized or adequately protected from contact.</p>

<p>The SIA testified (Tr. 158, 3-22-88) that the suggested Issue L-5
wording was too vague and recommended that specification-type
language, rather than performance-oriented terminology, "may be more
practical and enforceable when you are dealing with exposure of this
type." The SIA further stated:</p>

<p>We certainly do have the hazard there, particularly in people
erecting the scaffolds and people working on them. There's a great
problem when people go out to erect a scaffold around a building,
there is high voltage wire close by. The question has always been,
well how close can we get to it? Based on California in their table in
some instances they say 6 feet. Some people say that is too close and
I don't know but I think that is really something you need to address
to get input from people who are experts in that area (Tr. 169).</p>

<p>EEI testified (Ex. 11; Tr. 180, 3/22/88) that OSHA should promulgate
the proposed ten-foot minimum clearance between a scaffold and
energized and exposed power lines; that the installation of protective
devices on the power lines be done by "trained utility line
technicians"; that the ten foot proximity rule should apply to "any
conductive extension or persons" on a scaffold (Tr. 190-191); and that
the Hearing Notice Issue L-5 language regarding protective coverings
for energized lines was "not a safe standard * * *"</p>

<p>In addition, EEI supported requiring employers to notify utilities
before erecting scaffolds in proximity to energized lines, so that the
utilities could determine how to protect scaffold workers. EEI also
stated (Tr. 181):</p>

<p>Any final standard must make it clear that the 10 foot or more
clearances are to be observed unless the line is deenergized or unless
the utility plainly advises the employer that it is safe for the
particular condition involved to erect a scaffold in closer proximity
to the lines than the 10 feet allowed.</p>

<p>It must also be made clear in the final standard that the utility
will have no obligation to be [de]energized or to take steps to
protect lines and that, if the utility deems it appropriate to do
neither, that the 10-foot clearance distance as a minimum * * * must
be observed.</p>

<p>The EEI described the procedures by which employers contact
utilities when employees need to work in proximity to energized lines,
as follows:</p>

<p>In Wisconsin as part of a one-call system that originated for
digging in the ground to avoid contact with buried facilities. We have
incorporated notification for all electric facilities. So contractors
in Wisconsin who are approaching a job where they detect the presence
of overhead conductors can use the one-call system to notify the
utility of their intent to work. And within 72 hours the utility comes
out and inspects and tells them what they are proposing is reasonable
or not. I am sure there are other states with similar provisions (Tr.
187).</p>

<p>In response to a question about how work could proceed when a
scaffold must be erected within ten feet of an energized line and the
utility refuses to de-energize the line, EEI testified (Tr. 198) that
the architects and planners for the structure should consider the line
when planning the project. Otherwise, he added, there "* * * would
have to be a delay until some appropriate protection or alternate feed
for that facility was established."</p>

<p>Bristol Steel (Exs. 5a-3 and 13) supported focusing attention on the
safeguards necessary to address problems associated with power lines,
stating that the proposed language to require maintaining a safe
distance from power lines or de-energizing the lines to protect
employees from the lines was warranted.</p>

<p>The SSFI (Ex. 5a-19) expressed support for the proposed requirement
that an appropriate distance be maintained between scaffolds and
energized power lines.</p>

<p>The third substantive change made in the final rule to proposed
paragraph (d)(6) was the revision of proposed paragraph (d)(6)(iii) to
increase the minimum clearance between scaffolds and lines to 3 feet
instead of 2 feet. This change was based on the 1990 editions of two
national consensus standards, the National Electrical Safety Code
(NESC) and the National Electrical Code (NEC).</p>

<p>NESC Rule 234C specifies clearances from the nearest conductive
surface to the nearest surface of a building or its projections or its
attachments (scaffolds). The required horizontal clearance to
buildings is intended to provide adequate working space between the
conductors or cables and the building surface to permit workers with
small hand tools to conduct maintenance on a building or other
structure. Trained workers using specialized maintenance tools would
also be provided with adequate clearance.</p>

<p>Specifically, NESC Rule 24C3c(2) states the following:</p>

<p>Service-drop conductors shall not be readily accessible, and when
not in excess of 750 volts, they shall have a clearance of not less
than 3 feet in any direction from windows, doors, porches, fire
escapes, or similar locations.</p>

<p>Section 24C3c(2) was added in the 1984 edition of the NESC to be
consistent with Article 230-24(c) of the NEC. Article 230 of the NEC
covers service conductors.</p>

<p>In the NEC, Article 230-24(c) covers clearances of all overhead
service-drop conductors, and simply refers to Article 230-9,
"Clearances from Building Openings." Article 230-9, based on no wind
loading, states the following: "Service conductors installed as open
conductors or multiconductor cable without an overall outer jacket
shall have a clearance of not less than 3 feet from windows, doors,
porches, fire escapes, or similar locations."</p>

<p>With no wind loading, the horizontal clearance from the scaffold to
the service conductors must be at least 3 feet. Where wind loading
might cause the conductor to be displaced, the original clearance
distance must be expanded to assure that at least 3 feet of clearance
is maintained between the scaffold and the displaced conductor.</p>

<p>Paragraph (f)(7) of the final rule provides that scaffolds shall
only be erected, moved, dismantled, or altered under the supervision
and direction of a competent person. That paragraph further provides
that the listed activities shall be performed only by experienced and
trained employees selected for such work by the competent person. This
provision is similar to proposed paragraph (d)(7), which was
effectively identical to existing &#167; 1926.451(a)(3).</p>

<p>OSHA received one comment (Ex. 2-23) which recommended the addition
of "and direction" between the words "supervision" and "of" because it
would otherwise infer that the supervision need not be at the scene
directing the work. OSHA believes such direct supervision is
necessary, and has revised the final rule to clarify this point. This
commenter also suggested that a qualified person rather than a
competent person be required by this provision. The commenter defined
a qualified person as "a person designated by the employer who by
reason of experience or instruction is familiar with the operation to
be performed and the hazards involved." OSHA acknowledges that the
proposed language does not clearly address the qualifications of a
competent person charged with directing scaffold work. Therefore, the
Agency has revised the language to indicate clearly that the competent
person must be "qualified" (as defined in &#167; 1926.32(m)) in the subject
matters for which that person has responsibility.</p>

<p>The Agency has also clarified that the actual work be performed by
experienced and trained employees, selected by the competent person.
This change is based on an ACCSH recommendation (Tr. 88-92, 6-9-87).
In particular, a member of the Advisory Committee stated "it needs to
be employees that are properly trained and experienced being the only
ones allowed to do this kind of work." OSHA agrees with this
recommendation because, unlike other individuals on a finished
scaffold, erectors and disassemblers are exposed to the hazards of
working on a partially completed structure, and a competent person is
needed to select the proper individuals to do this work.</p>

<p>Paragraph (f)(8) of the final rule provides that employees are
prohibited from working on scaffolds covered with snow, ice, or other
slippery material except as necessary for removal of such materials.
This provision is identical to proposed paragraph (d)(8), which was
intended to clarify existing &#167; 1926.451(a)(17). The existing standard
simply required that "slippery conditions on scaffolds shall be
eliminated as soon as possible after they occur."</p>

<p>The Agency recognizes that the situation addressed by this provision
differs from situations where workers could be required to work on
scaffolds during storms or high winds, which is addressed by
&#167; 1926.451(f)(12) (discussed below). OSHA notes that snow and ice
removal can be done from ground level on one level built-up scaffolds
(approximately 6 feet) and on suspended scaffolds, since they are
usually accessed at ground level. When dealing with a two or more
level built-up scaffold, removal of slippery material would be
conducted above the 10-foot trigger height requiring normal fall
protection precautions. On the other hand, work on scaffolds during
storms or high winds poses a much greater risk of falling for workers,
especially on tall scaffolds where wind velocity can be much greater
than at ground level. In these situations, materials handling, or even
normal activities such as walking, are adversely affected to the point
where guardrails alone might not be sufficiently protective. Under
these circumstances, the Agency intends the competent person to
determine if the work can be done safely, and the employer to ensure
that those employees are provided extra protection through the use of
personal fall arrest systems or wind screens. This provision is
discussed further below.</p>

<p>Paragraph (f)(9) of the final rule requires that, where swinging
loads are being hoisted on, to, or near scaffolds such that the loads
could contact the scaffold, tag lines or equivalent measures shall be
utilized to stabilize the loads. This provision is effectively
identical to proposed paragraph (d)(9). The proposed rule was based on
1910.28(a)(15), which requires tag lines only when loads are being
hoisted onto the scaffold. The provision covers all hoisting
operations in proximity to scaffolds, because a swinging load can pose
a hazard regardless of its destination. OSHA has made a minor
editorial revision to the proposed rule for the sake of clarity.</p>

<p>Final rule paragraph (f)(10) requires that support ropes used with
adjustable suspension scaffolds have sufficient diameter for
functioning of the brakes and the hoist mechanism. As discussed above
in relation to final rule &#167; 1926.451(a), OSHA has relocated this
provision, which is effectively identical to proposed paragraph
(a)(4)(i), to consolidate the requirements for rope used with
suspension scaffolds.</p>

<p>Paragraph (f)(11) of the final rule requires that suspension ropes
be shielded when a heat-producing process is performed. When acids or
other corrosive substances are used on a scaffold, the ropes shall be
shielded, treated to protect against the corrosive substances, or
shall be of a material which is not adversely affected by the
substance being used. This provision is identical to proposed
paragraph (d)(10). The proposal was essentially the same as existing
&#167; 1926.451(a)(18), which prohibits the use of any heat producing process
on scaffolds supported by fiber or synthetic rope and requires that
only treated or protected fiber or synthetic ropes be used near
corrosive substances. Unlike the existing rule, the revised standard
allows the use of heat producing processes, as long as the ropes are
shielded. The provisions for protection of scaffolds and their
components from corrosive substances and from heat-producing processes
are consistent with ANSI A10.8-1988, Sections 4.27 and 4.28,
respectively.</p>

<p>Final rule paragraph (f)(12) prohibits work on or from scaffolds
during storms or high winds unless a competent person has determined
that it is safe for employees to be on the scaffold and these
employees are protected by a personal fall arrest system or wind
screens. Wind screens shall not be used unless the scaffold is secured
against the forces imposed. The proposed rule (paragraph (d)(11)) was
based on general industry regulation 1910.28(a)(18), which provides
that employees shall not work on scaffolds during storms or high
winds.</p>

<p>Proposed paragraph (d)(11) prohibited work on scaffolds during
storms or when wind speeds exceeded 40-mph, unless body belt or
harness systems were used or wind screens were erected. The proposed
rule, like the final rule, provided that wind screens could only be
used if the scaffold was secured against the forces imposed. Issue 6
of the NPRM requested comments on whether the proposed 40-mph limit
was appropriate and on how to measure the wind speed.</p>

<p>Two commenters (Exs. 2-22 and 2-53) supported the proposed 40-mph
limit. Two other commenters (Exs. 2-13 and 2-41) stated that 25 mph
would be a more appropriate limit. Other commenters (Exs. 2-54 and
2-64) stated that 40 mph is too high a limit, because of the dangers
high winds present, but did not suggest an alternative limit. Two
commenters (Exs. 2-64 and 2-368) stated that no specific limit should
be set because of the variations in wind speed from ground level to
higher elevations, and from building side to building side. Several
commenters from the AGC (Exs. 2-20, 2-55, 2-70, 2-390, and 2-516)
stated that contractors are presently using "good judgement" in
determining when work should cease and that there are no statistics to
show otherwise.</p>

<p>The SSFI and the SIA (Exs. 2-367 and 2-368) stated that the most
recent draft language used in the ANSI A10.8 standard should be used.
As adopted, ANSI A10.8-1988, Section 4.22, provides "[w]orkers shall
not work on scaffolds during storms or high winds." In particular, the
SSFI (Ex. 2-367) stated "[t]here are too many variables for a specific
wind speed to be determined by a governmental agency." That commenter
also recommended that OSHA use the term "high wind" without specifying
a wind speed, and that the Agency let individual workers determine if
the work should be performed under those conditions. The SIA (Ex.
2-368) stated "a set limit of mph can be misleading and dangerous in
that the wind velocity can be 15 mph or lower, yet the side of the
building the men are working on can have gusts in excess of 40 mph.
* * * Wind will vary on each side of a building."</p>

<p>The ACCSH (Tr. 65-79, 6/9/87) recommended that the determination of
wind hazard should be made by a "competent person." OSHA agrees that
designating a competent person to evaluate wind conditions is the
appropriate way to ensure that all the relevant information and the
unique aspects of work locations are considered. OSHA believes this is
a more appropriate way to address the problem than simply specifying a
speed limit without regard to other factors. Accordingly, the Agency
has revised the final rule to reflect the ACCSH suggestion to use a
competent person and the suggestions to use the ANSI language.</p>

<p>Final rule paragraph (f)(13) provides that debris shall not be
allowed to accumulate on platforms, where it could pose a slip, trip,
or fall hazard to employees on or below the platform. This provision
is identical to proposed paragraph (d)(12), which was based on
existing 1910.28(a)(20). This provision is consistent with ANSI
A10.8-1988, Section 4.24.</p>

<p>Final rule paragraph (f)(14) provides that makeshift devices, such
as but not limited to boxes and barrels, shall not be used on top of
scaffold platforms to increase the working level height of employees.
The Agency has concluded that these makeshift devices will not meet
the pertinent criteria of this final rule, in terms of strength and
stability.</p>

<p>Final rule paragraph (f)(15) prohibits the use of ladders on
scaffolds to increase the employee's working level except when the
employees are on large area scaffolds and the ladder is used in
accordance with the applicable provisions of final rule paragraph
(f)(15)(i)-(iv), discussed below.</p>

<p>The corresponding paragraph in the proposal provided simply that
ladders and makeshift devices not be used to increase scaffold working
heights. This provision was intended to ensure that workers were
provided with a secure work platform, and to eliminate the hazard of
tipping caused by portable ladders exerting a sideways thrust on
scaffold systems. The pertinent provisions are consistent with the
corresponding language in ANSI A10.8-1988, Section 4.29.</p>

<p>NPRM Issue 29 requested public comment on the need for the proposed
prohibition against the use of ladders on scaffolds. Three commenters
(Exs. 2-40, 2-53, and 2-69) favored the use of body/safety belts in
such situations. Of these three, both NIOSH (Ex. 2-40) and another
commenter (Ex. 2-69) noted that there would be no need to prevent the
tipping of a scaffold from sideways thrust exerted by a ladder if the
scaffold were secured laterally. Those commenters added that employees
working above the guardrail system could be guarded from falls by
using a body belt. In addition, NIOSH (Ex. 2-40) provided examples,
noting that tiebacks, guys, or braces would be used to secure a
scaffold. NIOSH also suggested that OSHA consider requiring "form
scaffolds" to be near the top of concrete forms. The commenter
indicated that this would "eliminate the need for workers to be above
the scaffold fall protection system." However, NIOSH stated that no
data exist to support this recommendation concerning form scaffolds.
The other commenter (Ex. 2-53) who supported the use of personal fall
arrest systems stated "safety belts must be used" when ladders or
other devises are used on top of scaffolds to increase the working
level heights of employees.</p>

<p>One commenter (Ex. 2-15) favored the proposed prohibition of the use
of ladders or makeshift devices to raise the working level of
employees, provided that the prohibition pertains only to scaffolds
subject to tipping that do not completely cover an enclosed area. In
particular, this commenter stated that the proposed prohibition should
not apply to scaffolds built from wall to wall with the entire floor
area covered and with a completely decked top (in effect, a large area
scaffold) from which several trades could use ladders or small
scaffolds to do their work. In addition, two commenters (Exs. 2-1 and
2-54) who addressed proposed paragraph (d)(13), rather than Issue 29,
indicated that ladders can be used on large area scaffolds when
additional precautions are taken.</p>

<p>One commenter (Ex. 2-64) supported applying the proposed prohibition
to suspended scaffolds but did not address other scaffolds. Another
commenter (Ex. 2-13) stated that no ladder or makeshift device "should
be used to increase the height of a scaffold."</p>

<p>In addition, four commenters (Exs. 2-29, 2-43, 2-367 and 2-368)
explicitly and unconditionally supported the proposed prohibition. Two
commenters (Exs. 2-29 and 2-43) very briefly stated that the use of
ladders and makeshift devices on top of scaffolds to raise working
levels should be prohibited. The SSFI (Ex. 2-367) supported the
proposed prohibition and stated that the use of ladders and makeshift
devices on top of scaffolds makes scaffold systems unstable. The SIA
(Ex. 2-368) supported the proposed prohibition and stated that
accident statistics "reveal a number of injuries and fatalities due to
workers improvising ladders and makeshift devices to obtain greater
working heights from scaffolds."</p>

<p>After carefully considering the above comments and the
recommendation from the ACCSH, OSHA has determined that the proposed
prohibition of the use of ladders and makeshift devices on top of
scaffolds is necessary to ensure employee safety. However, the Agency
has also determined that the use of ladders on large area scaffolds is
consistent with efforts to ensure employee safety. As noted above in
the discussion of the definition for "Large area scaffold", these
scaffolds cover substantially the entire work area, and are basically
equivalent to working on a floor or large deck of a structure, where
ladders can be used safely. Therefore, the final rule prohibits the
use of makeshift devices on all scaffolds and prohibits the use of
ladders on scaffolds other than large area scaffolds.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the OSHA has determined that the requirements in
proposed &#167; 1926.451(d)(13), which addressed the use of both ladders and
makeshift devices in one provision, should be separated into two
paragraphs so that the final rule clearly expresses the Agency's
regulatory intent. The proposed rule has been revised accordingly.</p>

<p>Final rule paragraph (f)(15)(i) provides that when a ladder is
placed against a structure which is not a part of the scaffold, the
scaffold must be secured against the sideways thrust exerted by the
ladder. This provision was suggested by NIOSH and other commenters on
Issue 29. In addition, paragraphs (f)(15)(ii) through (iv) require
that the platform units be secured to the scaffold to prevent them
from moving; that the ladder legs are all on the same platform unit
unless other means have been provided to stabilize the ladder against
platform unit deflection; and that the ladder legs be secured to
prevent them from slipping and being pushed off the platform unit.
These provisions are based on suggestions made by commenters on Issue
29, as discussed above.</p>

<p>The Agency believes that compliance with these provisions will
prevent the tipping and instability hazards that led OSHA to propose a
prohibition against the use of ladders on all scaffolds, and has
revised the final rule accordingly.</p>

<p>Final rule paragraph (f)(16) provides that platform units shall not
deflect more than 1/60 of the span when loaded. This provision is
identical to proposed paragraph (d)(14), and is intended to limit the
amount platform units can deflect under load without becoming
overstressed and without their ends being pulled from their supports.</p>

<p>Final rule paragraph (f)(17) requires employers to reduce the
possibility of welding current arcing through suspension wire rope
while employees are performing welding from suspended scaffolds by
insulating the suspended platform and its rigging. OSHA is adding this
new provision to protect employees from the electrocution and platform
collapse hazards posed by arcing welding current. In particular, the
Agency requires that employers rig affected scaffolds with insulated
thimbles (paragraph (f)(17)(i)), insulated wire rope (paragraph
(f)(17)(ii)), and insulated hoist mechanisms (paragraph (f)(17)(iii)).
This paragraph also specifies precautions for grounding the scaffold
to the structure on which welding is being performed (paragraphs
(f)(17)(iv-vi)). These provisions are consistent with ANSI
A10.8-1988, Section 6.2.9.</p>

<p>Issue 2 of the NPRM requested comment on the need to regulate
welding equipment used on suspended scaffolds and solicited input
regarding regulatory text then being considered by the ANSI A10.8
Committee. That text, divided into six items, was effectively
identical to the language OSHA has promulgated in paragraph (f)(17).</p>

<p>Four commenters (Exs. 2-20, 2-55, 2-69, and 2-390) stated that this
subject should be covered by the welding standards for construction
(part 1926, subpart J), since the hazards involved in these operations
related directly to welding. The National Constructors Association
(NCA) (Ex. 2-53) went further, saying "[t]here is no need to regulate
electric welding equipment on scaffolds. NCA member companies do not
have any experience that would indicate additional regulations."</p>

<p>One respondent (Ex. 2-8) stated that OSHA needed to define the term
"suitable" as used in describing an insulated thimble (Item (a) of
Issue 2, promulgated as paragraph (f)(17)(i)), because "[s]omeone
might think that putting electric tape on a metal thimble is
"suitable" insulation." OSHA agrees that the term "suitable" could be
interpreted in a way that would result in inadequate insulation and
has adopted regulatory text requiring an "insulated thimble" that
provides appropriate protection for the equipment in use.</p>

<p>Another commenter (Ex. 2-13) stated "[t]he only rule that could
possibly help prevent accidents from welding on suspended scaffolds is
to ground the scaffold. All the scaffold components are conductors and
all could possibly be grounded through the suspension ropes. A
secondary path, of lesser resistance, could possibly help."</p>

<p>In addition, a commenter (Ex. 2-22) stated that requiring employers
to cover each hoist with protective covers made from insulating
material (Item (c) of Issue 2, promulgated as paragraph (f)(17)(iii))
would have a prohibitive cost without having an impact on safety,
noting that a "great number" of hoists are used on scaffolds. The
commenter added that the provision requiring a grounding conductor to
be connected from the unit to the structure (Item (d) of Issue 2,
promulgated as paragraph (f)(17)(iv)) may not be practicable "because
in actual field situations the machines are constantly and frequently
moved." In addition, the commenter stated that the requirement to turn
off the welding machine if the unit grounding lead is disconnected at
any time (Item (e) of Issue 2, promulgated as paragraph (f)(17)(v))
may be impractical, because "in actual field situations the machine
may be 50 or more feet from the scaffold." Another commenter (Ex.
2-29) suggested that "[r]equirements should be more
performance-oriented to allow alternative methods to protect the
employees working with electric welding equipment on suspended
scaffolds."</p>

<p>Several commenters (Exs. 2-43, 2-54, 2-64, 2-367, and 2-368)
expressed concern over the hazards of using electric welding equipment
on suspended scaffolds and indicated that they favored promulgation of
the measures raised in Issue 2. One commenter (Ex. 2-64) noted that
OSHA had used the term "unit" instead of the terms "scaffold" or
"platform" in Items (d) and (e) of Issue 2 and stated that one of
those other terms should be used instead of "unit", for the sake of
clarity. OSHA agrees that the term "scaffold" more clearly expresses
the Agency's intent.</p>

<p>In addition, the SSFI (Ex. 2-367) and the SIA (Ex. 2-368) stated
"the specific recommendations developed by OSHA regarding electric
welding equipment are felt to be practical and feasible as several
manufacturers are already using or specifying many of the methods
outlined within the suggested rules."</p>

<p>Also, on June 9, 1987 (Tr. 26-30), the ACCSH recommended that OSHA
regulate electric welding equipment on suspended scaffolds under
subpart L. In particular, a member of the Advisory Committee stated
"[t]here's a very distinct possibility that you can arc within the
suspended cables, burn the cable and drop the scaffold. That's exactly
why it needs to be addressed."</p>

<p>Another commenter (Ex. 2-516) expressed concern regarding the
protection provided by insulated thimbles, because "[a]n insulated
thimble does not prevent the wire rope from hitting the conducting
aluminum skin on the structure and closing the loop. It doesn't stop
the huge current from burning out the power cord and melting the
insulation on the `hot' power leads." The commenter also stated that
using more than one ground lead can allow current to "get loose",
blowing out adjacent electrical systems and damaging platforms and
their rigging. In particular, the commenter stated "[p]art of our
problem is that the current from welding machines is high enough to
cause heat damage in metal. The damage manifests itself as melted
metal at the material surface or interface between materials. This
damage seriously reduces strength. Strength is needed to keep the
platform from falling."</p>

<p>The Agency acknowledges that insulated thimbles, alone, do not
prevent arcing, and that grounding must be undertaken with great care
to minimize stray currents. OSHA has determined that compliance with
the provisions of paragraph (f)(17), taken together, will minimize the
hazards of electric arcing during welding operations on suspended
scaffolds. The Agency has concluded that it is appropriate to address
the hazard of arcing welding current during welding operations on
suspended scaffolds in the final rule for scaffolds, rather than in
the welding standards, because the precautions in question relate to
the scaffold rigging, not to welding procedures, and because placing
the pertinent regulatory text in the rule will facilitate compliance.</p>

<p><b class="ITALICS">Paragraph 1926.451(g) Fall Protection.</b></p>

<p>Paragraph (g) of the final rule sets fall protection requirements
for employees working on scaffolds, including criteria for guardrail
systems. As discussed above, fall hazards account for a high
percentage of the injuries and fatalities experienced by scaffold
workers. OSHA has determined that compliance with this paragraph will
effectively protect employees from those hazards.</p>

<p>Final rule paragraph (g)(1) sets 10 feet as the threshold height
above which fall protection is required and indicates (paragraphs
(g)(1)(i)--(vii)) what fall protection measures are required for
particular types of scaffolds. In addition, the introductory text
references paragraph (g)(2), which addresses the fall protection
requirements for employees erecting and dismantling supported
scaffolds. Finally, a note has been added at the end of paragraph
(g)(1), to indicate clearly that the fall protection requirements for
employees installing suspension scaffold support systems on floors,
roofs, and other elevated surfaces are set forth in subpart M (Fall
protection) of the construction standards.</p>

<p>Proposed paragraph (e)(1), dealing with fall protection, was
similar, except that it explicitly excluded erectors and dismantlers
from coverage. As with the proposed access provision (proposed
paragraph (c)), OSHA believed at that time that fall protection
requirements would only be feasible when a scaffold was fully erected
and properly braced. The following paragraphs first discuss the issue
of height requirements for fall protection on scaffolds and then
describe the issues surrounding fall protection for erectors and
dismantlers.</p>

<p>The issue of the appropriate height at which to require fall
protection for employees working on scaffolds is complex, involving
analyses of accident statistics, economic issues, strongly held
opinions, and most importantly, concern for employee protection. OSHA
has been involved with this issue since its inception in 1971, when
the Agency adopted, under Section 6(a) of the Act, a requirement that
scaffolds used in construction require fall protection for employees
working at heights greater than 6 feet. By 1972, however, it had
become apparent that this height requirement was proving onerous and
causing disruption for scaffold users in the construction industry,
and the Agency accordingly revised the height requirement to 10 feet
(37 FR 25712, December 2, 1972). This change recognized the fact that
the relevant consensus standard, ANSI A10.8-1969, Section 3.3 had set
the threshold height for scaffold fall protection at 10 feet, and that
this had become the industry standard of practice. OSHA's action also
underscored the need for consistency in height requirements for
general industry and construction unless there are compelling reasons
for a different height requirement (the general industry standard's
height threshold had already been set at 10 feet, in accordance with
the ANSI standard). An example of a situation where a different height
requirement is appropriate is the fall protection height requirement
for scaffolds used in shipyards (29 CFR 1915). This height threshold
differs from that in general industry and construction because
shipyard work is less transient and less dynamic than construction
work. For example, it is not uncommon for a scaffold to be erected in
the shipyard environment and to remain in place for several years as
employees work on various vessels that are brought to the scaffold
"work station" to be repaired. In addition, shipyard facilities are
completed, finished structures, unlike construction sites, where
activities and crews change daily. Finally, the 5-foot threshold for
fall protection on scaffolds has a long history in this industry: it
has been standard industry practice since well before OSHA was
established.</p>

<p>The fall protection height requirement in the final rule continues
the height requirement that has been in place in OSHA's construction
standards since 1972; this height threshold is also the current
recommendation of the relevant ANSI standard, A10.8-1988. OSHA's
decision on this issue is based on the Agency's professional judgment
and its experience in enforcing this fall protection requirement in
the existing scaffold standards, a review of the available accident
statistics and studies, and an analysis of the record on this issue.
The following paragraphs discuss this information in greater detail.</p>

<p>First, OSHA has been enforcing this limit for almost a quarter of a
century and has found that employers working in all areas of
construction, from commercial building to the specialty trades,
recognize and comply with this limit. In addition, construction
workers are familiar with and have been trained to use fall protection
on scaffolds at heights of 10 feet and above. Thus, this height
requirement reflects current industry practice and is widely observed
by employers and employees alike.</p>

<p>Second, the accident data on falls among construction workers
suggest that several other areas of construction safety--such as
scaffold stability, protection from electrocution hazards, and
protection from falling objects while working on scaffolds--may have a
greater impact on injuries and fatalities than fall protection height.
An unpublished BLS study, entitled Work Injury Report on Scaffolds,
analyzed work injury reports related to scaffolds submitted from May
to November 1978. The study showed that many causes contribute to
scaffold-related injuries and fatalities (Ex. 3-1). For example,
one-quarter of the accidents related to scaffolds occurred while
workers were ascending or descending a scaffold or stepping onto or
off a scaffold, and 72 percent of these accidents occurred when the
planking or support collapsed or slipped (Ex. 3-1).</p>

<p>A recent OSHA review of the Agency's Integrated Management
Information System (IMIS) records of falls in the construction
industry in the period from April 1984 to June 1994 provided
information regarding 32 fatalities and 60 injuries related to work on
scaffolds that occurred during this interval. Of these, only three
fatalities and six injuries involved heights in the 6 to 10-foot
range.</p>

<p>OSHA received many comments on the height threshold for fall
protection for work conducted on scaffolds (Exs. 2-3, 2-9, 2-13, 2-14,
2-15, 2-21, 2-22, 2-29, 2-31, 2-40, 2-41, 2-43, 2-45, 2-54, 2-57,
2-69, 2-70, 2-367, 2-368, 2-407, 2-465, 2-595, 5a-3, 5a-5, 5a-17, and,
5a-19). These commenters argued either for changing the existing
rule's height threshold or for retaining it. Those in favor of a
different limit argued for fall protection at all heights (Tr.
115-116, 6-8-87, ACCSH transcript), 4 feet (Exs. 2-14, 2-40, 2-45,
2-54, and 2-465), 5 feet (Ex. 2-29), and 6 feet (Exs. 2-15, 2-57).
OSHA's Advisory Committee for Construction Safety and Health (ACCSH)
urged the Agency to require fall protection on all scaffolds,
regardless of elevation (Tr. 115-116, 6-8-87); however, at least one
other rulemaking participant (Ex. 2-594) argued that such a
requirement would be unrealistic. OSHA solicited other comments and
data on this ACCSH recommendation in Issue L-2 of the hearing notice
(53 FR 2050), and received several comments that such a requirement
would not be appropriate (Exs. 5a-3, 5a-5, 5a-17, 5a-19). This group
of commenters urged OSHA to retain the 10-foot requirement.</p>

<p>Those commenters favoring fall protection heights in the 4- to
6-foot range gave many reasons for their views. For example, one
commenter (Ex. 2-14) stated that falls from heights of four to five
feet could cause serious injuries "especially if the fall occurs on a
hard surface with debris scattered about." According to the Research &#38;
Trading Corporation (Ex. 2-45):</p>

<p>[f]our feet is consistent with current [general industry] standards
for scaffold guarding [1910.23(c))]. Four feet according to the NBS
study on nets (NBSIR 85-3271) is the height beyond which a worker is
most likely to hit his head when an accidental fall occurs, which is
to be prevented if possible. Six feet is useful as a universal
compromise for OSHA from its current slew of height requirements.
However, it should be no more than six (6) feet.</p>

<p>Another commenter (Ex. 2-29) argued for five feet on the grounds
that guarding any height above one section of scaffold, which is about
five feet, would be protective. Both the ANSI Z359 committee and
Saf-T-Green (Exs. 2-57 and 2-15) favored a 6-foot fall protection
threshold. Saf-T-Green reasoned that an even lower limit might be
preferable but acknowledged that there is "some validity to the claim
that one can jump clear of a small, low rolling tower as it tips if
there is no guardrail. However, if the tower does not tip, a guardrail
would protect against the employee falling over the edge." Another
commenter (Ex. 5a-3) argued that consistency with the fall protection
requirements of subpart M (Fall Protection) would suggest that a
6-foot threshold was appropriate for scaffolds.</p>

<p>Many commenters urged the Agency to retain the 10-foot fall
protection threshold for scaffolds (Exs. 2-3, 2-9, 2-13, 2-21, 2-22,
2-39, 2-43, 2-69, 2-70, 2-367, 2-368, 2-407, 2-595, 5a-3, 5a-5,
5a-17, 5a-19). According to these commenters, it is important to
establish the height at which fall protection is and is not required
(Ex. 2-595) and the 10-foot threshold has proved both protective and
cost-effective. For example, one commenter (Ex. 2-41) stated:</p>

<p>. . . My investigations led me to believe that work at over ten foot
elevated surfaces was at the very least four times as hazardous as
work at grade, and the injuries were far more serious. I did not feel
that any data I saw warranted a conclusion that the increased injury
was due to anything but [a] higher population working at the [higher]
level.</p>

<p>PPG Industries (Ex. 2-43) commented:</p>

<p>PPG has no problem with the 10 foot height as it stands. The problem
lies in the design of the equipment and the failure of workers to
follow safe practices.</p>

<p>OSHA has carefully analyzed all of the comments and data available
in the record and has determined that it is appropriate to maintain
the 10-foot fall protection threshold in the final scaffold standard,
as proposed. This is also the height requirement recommended by the
current national consensus standard, ANSI A10.8-1988. This level
differs from the 6-foot threshold for fall protection set in subpart M
(Fall Protection) for other walking/working surfaces in construction
because scaffolds, unlike these other surfaces, are temporary
structures erected to provide a work platform for employees who are
constructing or demolishing other structures. The same features that
make scaffolds appropriate for short-term use in construction, such as
ease of erection and dismantling also make them less amenable to the
use of fall protection at the time the first level is being erected.
For example, there may be no secure place on the first level for the
installation of guardrails or personal fall arrest systems. Also there
is often no structure adjacent to a scaffold when the first level has
been erected that can be used to anchor a personal fall arrest system,
because the adjacent structure is in the process of being built or
demolished.</p>

<p>This scaffold standard contains many updated and strengthened
requirements for safe erection and maintenance of scaffolds. In
particular, the final rule sets clear, performance-oriented
requirements for scaffold capacity (&#167; 1926.451(a)); erection (&#167;&#167; 1926.451
(b), (c) and (d)); access (&#167; 1926.451(e); and use (&#167; 1926.451(f)). The
Agency has determined that compliance with the above-noted
requirements will prevent many of the fall-related injuries and
fatalities that would otherwise result from structural collapse or
instability, including those occurring on scaffolds less than 10 feet
in height, because properly erected scaffolds will not collapse during
use.</p>

<p>In addition, OSHA intends to monitor the extent to which compliance
with these revised subpart L requirements for structural integrity
effectively protects employees on scaffolds from fall hazards when
they are working between six and 10 feet above lower levels. At this
time, the data are insufficient to persuade the Agency that the
existing 10-foot threshold needs to be changed. OSHA will carefully
review and examine its enforcement data over the next several years,
together with any investigative reports and other information on
incidents that involve fall hazards. The Agency also intends to work
closely with NIOSH in performing such data collection and analysis.
Should it appear that compliance with this final rule is not providing
adequate fall protection for employees working on scaffolds between
six and 10 feet above lower levels, the Agency will reevaluate the
standards and determine what changes, if any, are warranted.</p>

<p>Paragraphs (g)(1)(i) through (vii) of the final rule specify the
types of fall protection to be used on particular types of scaffolds.
These provisions are essentially the same as the corresponding
proposed provisions, except as discussed below. The proposed and final
rule provisions effectively clarify and consolidate the fall
protection requirements in existing &#167; 1926.451(a)-(y), &#167; 1926.500(c)(2),
and &#167; 1926.1910.29(a)(3)(vii).</p>

<p>Paragraph (g)(1)(i) of the final rule, like proposed paragraph
(e)(1)(i), recognizes that personal fall arrest systems, not
guardrails, are appropriate for use on boatswains' chairs, catenary
scaffolds, float scaffolds, needle beam scaffolds, and ladder jack
scaffolds. This provision consolidates the following paragraphs of the
existing rule &#167; 1926.451(1)(4)--boatswains' chairs; (p)(9)--needle beam
scaffolds; (w)(6)--float scaffolds; and &#167; 1926.752(k)--float scaffolds
for steel erection. This requirement is being applied to catenary
scaffolds and ladder jack scaffolds for the first time.</p>

<p>Paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of the final rule, like proposed paragraph
(e)(1)(ii), requires personal fall arrest systems and guardrail
systems for all single-point adjustable suspension scaffolds (except
boatswains' chairs), and for all two-point adjustable suspension
scaffolds. The requirement to have guardrails and personal fall arrest
systems on two-point scaffolds, which carries forward language in
&#167; 1926.451(i)(8) of the existing rule, is based on the fact that a
guardrail system alone does not provide adequate fall protection when
a suspension rope fails and causes the scaffold to tip or hang from
only one end. Personal fall arrest system protection is also necessary
for single-point systems, because the fall hazard related to
suspension rope failure is as serious as it is with the two-point
scaffold. However, because personal fall arrest systems would be the
primary means of fall protection on single-point and two-point
systems, the provision allows a lower minimum strength guardrail
system to be used. This approach is consistent with that taken in the
proposed rule.</p>

<p>Paragraph (g)(1)(iii) of the final rule provides that "Each employee
on a crawling board (chicken ladder) shall be protected by a personal
fall arrest system, a guardrail system (with minimum 200 pound toprail
capacity), or by a three-fourth inch (1.9 cm) diameter grabline or
equivalent handhold securely fastened beside each crawling board."
This provision, like proposed paragraph (e)(1)(iii), is essentially
the same as paragraph &#167; 1926.451(v)(2) of the existing rule, except that
the existing rule permits grablines (lifelines) or equivalent
handholds if they are securely fastened alongside crawling boards.</p>

<p>Paragraph (g)(1)(iv) of the final rule, like proposed paragraph
(e)(1)(iv), provides that employees on self-contained scaffolds be
protected by both personal fall arrest systems and guardrail systems
when the platform is supported by ropes (as when the scaffold is being
raised or lowered on some systems) and by guardrail systems when the
platform is supported directly by the scaffold frame.</p>

<p>Paragraph (g)(1)(v) of the final rule, similar to proposed paragraph
(e)(1)(v), requires guardrails to be used along scaffold walkways and
to be located within 9 1/2 inches horizontally of at least one side of
the walkway. OSHA originally proposed that the walkways be located
within 8 inches horizontally of the side of the walkway. However, for
consistency with final rule &#167; 1926.451(b)(1)(ii), the provision has been
revised to allow an open space of up to 9 1/2 inches. The provision
that guardrails need only to be provided along one side applies only
when the platform is used solely as a means of access to get from one
point on the scaffold to another. If work activities other than access
are performed on or from the walkway, then the platform is not
considered to be a walkway (see definition of "walkway"), and other
provisions of paragraphs (g)(1), as appropriate, would apply.</p>

<p>Paragraph (g)(1)(vi) of the final rule provides that fall protection
(i.e., a personal fall arrest system or guardrail) be provided on all
open sides and ends of scaffolds from which employees are performing
overhand bricklaying operations and/or related work, except those
sides and ends next to the wall being laid. This requirement replaces
a note that followed proposed paragraph (e)(1)(v), which stated that
the fall protection requirements for employees performing overhand
bricklaying from supported scaffolds are provided in &#167; 1926.501, Fall
protection (subpart M). OSHA has deleted the note from the final rule
because the Agency has determined that, except for some system
criteria which are referenced from subpart M, it is appropriate to
cover all scaffold fall protection in this final rule for scaffolds in
construction (subpart L).</p>

<p>Paragraph (g)(1)(vi) of the final rule is consistent with
&#167; 1926.501(b)(9), which addresses fall protection for employees
performing overhand bricklaying while on elevated surfaces other than
scaffolds.</p>

<p>Final paragraph (g)(1)(vii) requires that employees on scaffolds not
addressed elsewhere in paragraph (g)(1) be protected either by
guardrails or personal fall arrest systems. This provision is
essentially the same as the fall protection requirement of proposed
paragraph (e)(1), except that the term "body belt/harness systems or
Type 1 guardrail systems" has been replaced by "personal fall arrest
systems or guardrail systems" for the reasons discussed above.</p>

<p>Paragraph (g)(1) does not apply where there are no "open sides or
ends" on the scaffold (see definition in &#167; 1926.451(b)). For the
scaffold to be considered completely enclosed, no perimeter face of
the scaffold may be more than 14 inches from a wall. The requirements
for fall protection will apply at openings such as hoistways, elevator
shafts, stairwells, or similar openings in the scaffold platform, or
openings in the walls of the structure surrounding the platform.</p>

<p>Proposed paragraph (e)(2) stated that each employee on a platform
(except for a self-contained adjustable scaffold or a scaffold type
covered by &#167; 1926.452), less than 45 inches (1.1 m) wide, and 4 feet
(1.2 m) or more above lower levels, shall be protected from falling to
those lower levels by the use of a personal fall arrest system or
guardrail system (with minimum 200 pound toprail capacity). Proposed
paragraph (e)(2) also provided a blanket exemption for
erecting/dismantling activities and referred to the use of a "Type I
guardrail system."</p>

<p>This provision, based on existing &#167; 1926.451(a)(4), has been dropped
in the final rule because further analysis of the requirement showed
that there was no real definable target for the requirement and that
99&#37; of scaffolds would be excluded by the proposed provision.</p>

<p>Paragraph (g)(2) of the final rule addresses fall protection for
employees erecting or dismantling supported scaffolds. Based on the
rulemaking record, developed through NPRM Issue 8 discussed below,
OSHA has determined that it is appropriate to delay the implementation
of paragraph (g)(2) until September 2, 1997. The delay will allow
affected employers sufficient time to implement the appropriate
procedures for addressing the fall protection needs of employees
erecting or dismantling scaffolds. In addition, deferring compliance
will allow time for the Agency to complete non-mandatory Appendix B,
which will provide examples of considerations that a competent person
would take into account when evaluating fall protection options for
scaffold erectors and dismantlers. As discussed above in relation to
final rule paragraph (e)(9), the Agency has also deferred requirements
for safe access for scaffold erectors and dismantlers until September
2, 1997.</p>

<p>Final paragraph (g)(2) requires that employers whose employees erect
or dismantle supported scaffolds after September 2, 1997 ensure that a
competent person determines the feasibility and safety of providing
fall protection for such employees. This paragraph further requires
that affected employers provide fall protection for employees erecting
or dismantling supported scaffolds where the installation and use of
such protection is feasible and does not create a greater hazard.</p>

<p>NPRM Issue 8 solicited comments concerning the proposed exemption
of employers whose employees perform scaffold erection and dismantling
operations from the fall protection requirements of proposed
&#167; 1926.451(e)(1). The Agency noted that, while supported scaffolds often
do not have a place to which personal fall arrest systems can be
properly attached, suspended scaffolds are often located such that
personal fall arrest systems can be used.</p>

<p>On March 29, 1993, based on the response to Issue 8, OSHA reopened
the public record for proposed subpart L (58 FR 16509) to obtain more
information. The Agency stated that the rulemaking record supported
deleting the proposed exemption of suspended scaffolds and indicated
that a blanket exemption for supported scaffolds might be
inappropriate. In particular, OSHA asked if employers should be
required to provide fall protection for employees erecting or
dismantling supported scaffolds, except where an employer can
demonstrate that providing fall protection was either "impracticable"
or "would create a greater hazard." The Agency also sought information
about current efforts and the ability to provide fall protection for
employees erecting or dismantling scaffolds. In addition, OSHA asked
if it was appropriate to require fall protection for those portions of
a supported scaffold that have been, or remain, fully assembled, while
exempting those areas where erecting or dismantling is underway.</p>

<p>The responses to NPRM Issue 8, and the March 29, 1993, reopening of
the record on this Issue fell into two broad groupings. The first
group either supported an across-the-board exemption from fall
protection requirements for all erectors and dismantlers (Exs. 2-3,
2-9, 2-12, and 2-21); or supported an exemption for erectors and
dismantlers of supported scaffolds only (Exs. 2-13, 2-15, 2-30, 2-69,
2-367 and 2-368); or specifically opposed a fall protection
requirement for erectors and dismantlers, even with an exception for
impracticability or greater hazard, favoring instead trained erectors
and dismantlers, a hazard awareness program, controlled access zones,
or a standardized procedure for erecting and dismantling scaffolds
(Exs. 34-5, 34-9, 34-10, 34-12, 34-17, 34-17, 34-20, 34-31, 34-32,
34-37, and 34-43).</p>

<p>The second group either supported a requirement for fall protection
at all times, including during erecting and dismantling (Exs. 2-22,
2-43, 2-45, 2-53, 2-497, 34-4, 34-11, and 34-35) or supported a
requirement for fall protection except where the employer demonstrates
that it is infeasible, unsafe, or creates a greater hazard during
erecting and dismantling operations (Exs. 2-29, 2-54, 2-57, 2-70,
34-2, 34-18, 34-19, 34-22, 34-26, 34-29, 34-34, and 34-46). Each of
these arguments is discussed below, along with OSHA's response to the
points raised by the commenters.</p>

<p>Commenters that supported the proposed total exemption of erecting
and dismantling operations from the fall protection requirements
argued (Ex. 2-3) "[t]his is a situation where someone must be exposed
in order to do the job * * *"; or felt that fall protection would be
detrimental to employee safety (Exs. 2-12 and 2-21). OSHA disagrees
with these commenters and notes that the record describes many
situations where it is feasible to provide fall protection for
erectors and dismantlers.</p>

<p>Commenters that supported a fall protection requirement for erectors
and dismantlers of suspended scaffolds, but not supported scaffolds
(Exs. 2-13, 2-15, 2-30, 2-69, 2-367, and 2-368) argued that it is
feasible and practical to require such protection for suspended
scaffolds, but not for supported scaffolds, due to the lack of an
appropriate tie-off area, and the possibility of drop lines becoming
entangled during climbing and moving procedures which could pull the
erector off the supported scaffold. The Agency agrees with these
commenters that it is virtually always feasible to provide fall
protection for workers erecting or dismantling suspended scaffolds
because structures that are capable of supporting a suspended scaffold
are also capable of providing a safe anchor point for personal fall
protection equipment. On the other hand, OSHA finds that the record
does not support an across-the-board exception from the requirements
for fall protection for erectors and dismantlers of supported
scaffolds.</p>

<p>Another group of commenters opposed a fall protection requirement
but emphasized the importance of training in maintaining safety during
erecting and dismantling operations. For example, some commenters
(Exs. 34-9, 34-10, 34-12, and 34-17) recommended the following:</p>

<p>1. A formal hazard awareness program shall be implemented.</p>

<p>2. Enforce "controlled access zones" allowing only those people
trained in the erection and dismantling of scaffolds to be present.</p>

<p>3. Develop and strictly enforce standard procedures for the erection
and dismantling of scaffolding. These procedures may include but not
be limited to the following:</p>

<p>a. Fully planking each level before moving on to the next highest
level.</p>

<p>b. Fully securing each level with the proper guardrails prior to
moving to the next higher level.</p>

<p>c. Providing proper access to all completed levels.</p>

<p>d. Develop methods for placing components on upper levels without
placing unnecessary risks on employees.</p>

<p>e. Only those employees actually involved in the erection or
dismantling shall be allowed on the scaffolding.</p>

<p>The Agency recognizes the importance of training and hazard
awareness programs to employee safety, but finds that these
precautions alone are not adequately protective because site
conditions change and mistakes are made. The Agency finds that
providing appropriate fall protection, whenever it is feasible or will
not create a greater hazard, is the best way to ensure that erectors
and dismantlers are appropriately protected from fall hazards.</p>

<p>The second group consisted of commenters that supported fall
protection for erectors and dismantlers under some (Exs. 2-29, 2-54,
2-57, 2-70, 34-2, 34-19, 34-22, 34-26, 34-29, and 34-46) or all
conditions (Exs. 2-22, 2-43, 2-45, 2-53, and 2-497). For example, some
commenters argued that if a fall hazard exists, lifelines or some
other fall arresting system should be in place. R&#38;TC (Ex. 2-45)
stated:</p>

<p>The use of lightweight outrigger scaffold sections with guard rails,
which can be pushed up the vertical scaffold poles prior to the new
upper level height exposure during erection, seems to be promising as
a fall protection means * * * Furthermore, many structures can provide
overhead anchorage points for workers during scaffold erection and
dismantling without such special scaffold platforms. For these
situations, regular lifelines can easily be used for vertical and
horizontal movement.</p>

<p>R&#38;TC later added (Ex. 2-497) "[w]hen an overhead anchorage is
available, a bucket truck, manlift or other elevating platform can be
used to install lifelines without a fall hazard."</p>

<p>Commenters to the Reopening Notice (Exs. 34-4, 34-11, 34-18, and
34-35) also supported a fall protection requirement for erectors and
dismantlers.</p>

<p>Some, such as Dynamic Scientific Controls (DSC) (Ex. 34-18) provided
input on ways to provide fall protection for erectors and dismantlers.
In particular, DSC provided a video showing a scaffold being erected
by an employee who uses a retractable lanyard attached to the scaffold
for fall protection. DSC stated that this method has been improved by
crossbracing the first frame, tying-in to the structure, using the
pulley bracket more often for attaching lifelines in order to reduce
the lifeline angle to less than 45 degrees, and pinning legs before
attaching the lifeline to a higher level. DSC added that using
horizontal lifelines within each frame and extending the length of the
scaffold can provide protection to workers as well. This commenter
noted, however, that any fall arrest system attached to a scaffold
should be an engineered system modelled for that type of scaffold, or
should be designed by a skilled professional engineer.</p>

<p>In addition, the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners (Ex.
34-11) stated that the ability to provide fall protection can be
greatly increased through modified erection, engineered attachment
points designed into structures, additional scaffold bracing, guying,
and outrigging.</p>

<p>Finally, DBI/SALA (Ex. 34-4) offered the following choices for fall
protection: "(1) Provide for or suggest a means for a feasible anchor;
(2) If the current state of the art doesn't allow scaffolds to be used
as anchors, maybe a redesign incorporating outriggers or whatever is
required is appropriate."</p>

<p>The Agency agrees that, if fall protection can be provided, it is
the employer's responsibility to take the actions necessary to protect
employees. However, OSHA has determined, based on the information in
the record, that in some situations, it is not possible to provide
fall protection for erectors and dismantlers of supported scaffolds.</p>

<p>Two commenters, Dynamic Scientific Controls (DSC) (Ex. 34-18) and
the State of Hawaii (Ex. 34-34) commented that the employer should be
required to show that fall protection is infeasible or creates a
greater hazard for the scaffold erector in order to avoid providing
fall protection. Another commenter (Ex. 2-54) added that employers
"should note in their Daily reports why they can't take [the]
necessary precaution[s]."</p>

<p>OSHA agrees that employers must have valid reasons for not providing
fall protection to scaffold erectors and dismantlers, but does not
agree that the employer must put these reasons in writing. Compliance
officers can substantiate employer claims of infeasibility or greater
hazard through on-site observations and discussion with the competent
person and other workers.</p>

<p>Many commenters (Exs. 2-29, 2-54, 2-57, 2-70, 34-2, 34-19, 34-22,
34-26, 34-29, and 34-46) supported a fall protection requirement for
scaffold erectors and dismantlers, if feasible, or unless it would
create a greater hazard. These commenters also provided insight into
the potential problems of providing fall protection for erectors and
dismantlers, and into the factors that must be considered when
determining if fall protection is feasible in a particular situation
or if the use of fall protection would create a greater hazard.</p>

<p>For example, the ANSI Z359 Committee (Ex. 2-57) stated:</p>

<p>It is recognized that fall protection may, in general, be difficult
or impractical to provide in erection and dismantling of supported
scaffolds. This may be due to absence of suitable anchorages whether
independent or integral to the scaffold. However, there are notable
exceptions when independent overhead anchorages exist which may be
used for vertical or horizontal lifelines. Further, some supported
scaffolds can be rigged to provide integral fall protection without
undue encumbrance of the work. There is concern that granting a broad
exemption from fall protection requirements for supported scaffold
erection/dismantling would reduce the protection even where it is
today feasible. Such exemptions could also discourage future
development of fall protection means to address this subject.</p>

<p>Miller &#38; Long (Ex. 2-70) commented "If there is an area where
employees can tie off they should do so."</p>

<p>The Boeing Company (Ex. 34-19) stated that fall protection for
erectors and dismantlers could be provided through the use of boom
supported elevated work platforms, scissors lifts, forklift platforms,
temporary guardrails, fall arrest/restraint systems or other
scaffolds.</p>

<p>The Scaffold Training Institute (STI) (Ex. 34-20) indicated that
100&#37; fall protection for erectors is not achievable from a practical
standpoint due to a lack of suitable anchorages. The Institute also
stated that lifelines would become entangled in pipes, lines,
platforms tubes, braces or other obstructions. STI was particularly
concerned that snagged lifelines would restrict the motion of
employees and could lead to falls for erectors whose work requires
that they have freedom of motion in order to carry and to maneuver
into place large, bulky components. The commenter added that the use
of lanyards and lifelines can lead to increased fall hazards, and that
a pendulum effect is created if an erector falls while attached to a
lifeline that is anchored several feet away.</p>

<p>Duke Power (Ex. 34-29) stated "[f]all protection harnesses tend to
snag on things, butt straps hinder climbing . . . Fall protection also
slows people down."</p>

<p>SINCO (Ex. 34-22) stated that the effect on the mobility of
employees varies with conditions and the type of fall protection
equipment used, but stated that the effect can be limited by proper
pre-planning and project management. In addition, both SINCO and
Professor Ralph E. Bennett of Purdue University (Ex. 34-26) suggested
that the scaffold must be properly tied or braced, with all components
pinned together, and, that intermediate plank levels be provided to
limit fall height during erection of the uppermost levels.</p>

<p>In addition, SINCO recommended that OSHA require affected employers
to satisfy the following criteria for exemption:</p>

<UL>
<LI><p>A qualified person has determined that fall protection creates a
greater hazard than falling freely to the ground or the closest
possible level;</p></LI>

<LI><p>Tests prove that a scaffold or structure would definitely fail if
used as an anchorage;</p></LI>

<LI><p>There are no other means of fall protection available;</p></LI>

<LI><p>Employees have been trained in the recognition and avoidance of
hazards by use of the employer's prescribed methods of erection; and</p></LI>

<LI><p>Compliance with the requirement for fall protection is likely to
result in a more serious injury compared to the possibility of a life
saved . . ."</p></LI>
</UL>

<p>SINCO observed that a greater hazard may exist if a falling person
could pull a scaffold over. However, the commenter added that this
hazard would involve more danger to employees on the ground than to
employees on the scaffold. They contended that other employees on the
scaffold may provide "counter-balance" that would prevent the scaffold
from overturning. In addition, SINCO stated that this hazard can be
prevented by reinforcing the scaffold's base through the use of
outriggers, counterweights, or tie-downs. The commenter added that
this hazard can be greatly reduced by requiring erectors to remain
inside the frames to decrease any eccentric loading and through the
use of shock absorbers.</p>

<p>Dow Chemical Co. (Ex. 34-46) commented that since each worksite is
unique, fall hazards must be addressed through preplanning of the work
with the aim of eliminating fall hazards and preventing falls.
However, the commenter added, where fall hazards cannot be eliminated,
a fall protection system should be used if it "provides a more
appropriately safe solution". Dow also stated that a lanyard long
enough to allow mobility can create tripping hazards and the potential
for one worker to "pull another worker from their task." The commenter
added that "people on-site must have the latitude to address [these
hazards]."</p>

<p>OSHA notes that the Agency's own compliance experience concerning
the potential problems of providing 100&#37; fall protection for erectors
and dismantlers is consistent with the positions put forth by the
commenters. OSHA has determined that it would be useful to provide
examples of the factors to be considered by a competent person when
deciding what fall protection is appropriate for employees erecting or
dismantling supported scaffolds. Accordingly, the Agency has reserved
non-mandatory Appendix B, and will be developing informational text
that can be added to subpart L at a later date to serve as a guide to
assist employers in evaluating their worksite conditions.</p>

<p>Several commenters (Exs. 34-8, 34-9, 34-10, 34-12, 34-17, 34-22, and
34-26) addressing the topic of fall protection for erectors and
dismantlers took no position as to an exception for these workers.
However, they indicated that fully planking sections could reduce
exposure to fall hazards. One of these commenters (Ex. 34-8) stated
that, although full planking and stairway-type ladders would reduce
exposure, their use is not always practical. In addition, four of
these commenters (Exs. 34-9, 34-10, 34-12, and 34-17) stated that
ladders attached at the end of the scaffold would be better because
stairway-type ladders greatly reduce employee movement along the
length of the scaffold.</p>

<p>Four other commenters (Exs. 34-32, 34-35, 34-37, and 34-39)
indicated that such practices would be either infeasible or would
create other hazards. The SIA and SSFI (Exs. 34-37 and 34-32) added
that planking every level would overload tall scaffolds and that
stairways are not needed because erectors do not continually climb up
and down. The SIA also said that fully planking every level would
require that all equipment be hoisted outside the scaffold, creating
additional hazards. Another commenter (Ex. 34-46) stated that a
requirement for fully planking sections "would unnecessarily restrict
local decisions for safety."</p>

<p>The Agency has determined that, due to the large variety of
supported scaffolds and an infinite number of unique site conditions
that could affect the feasibility or safety of providing fall
protection, neither a blanket exception nor a requirement for 100&#37;
fall protection is appropriate for erectors and dismantlers. OSHA
agrees with commenters (Exs. 34-8, 34-22, 34-36, and 34-46) that the
people on site (competent person) must have the flexibility to address
fall hazards for erectors and dismantlers on a site-specific basis.
Therefore, OSHA finds that the determination of what fall protection
is feasible and can be used safely at a given worksite should be made
by a competent person at the worksite. The competent person will need
to have the ability and knowledge to decide whether fall protection
can be provided for erectors and dismantlers under the specific site
conditions, and, if so, what measures are appropriate.</p>

<p>Therefore, the Agency has revised the final rule to reflect this
finding, while deferring compliance for one year to allow time for
employers to develop and implement the appropriate procedures. In
addition, as noted above, the Agency will be adding non-mandatory
Appendix B at a later date, to provide examples of situations where it
is feasible to provide fall protection during the erection and
dismantling of supported scaffolds and the criteria the competent
person would consider when deciding the appropriateness of fall
protection during erection and dismantling. Interested parties are
invited to provide OSHA with suggestions and information regarding the
appropriate guidance for the competent person.</p>

<p>Paragraph (g)(3) of the final rule provides that personal fall
arrest systems must comply with the pertinent provisions of
&#167; 1926.502(d) and, in addition, must be attached by lanyard to a
vertical lifeline, horizontal lifeline, or scaffold structural member.
However, when overhead obstructions such as overhead protection or
additional platform levels are part of a single-point or two-point
adjustable suspension scaffold, then vertical lifelines must not be
used, because, in the event of a scaffold collapse, the overhead
components would injure an employee who was tied off to a vertical
lifeline. This provision is essentially the same as proposed paragraph
(e)(3), except that the terms "dropline" and "trolley line" have been
replaced by the terms "vertical lifeline" and "horizontal lifeline" to
be consistent with the terms used in subpart M of this part--Fall
Protection.</p>

<p>Paragraph (g)(3)(i) of the final rule requires that vertical
lifelines, when used, be fastened to a fixed safe point of anchorage,
be independent of the scaffold, and be protected from sharp edges and
abrasion. Based on concern that inadequate anchor points may be used,
this paragraph also incorporates the language of the note to proposed
&#167; 1926.451(e)(3), which stated that safe points of anchorage include
structural members of buildings, but do not include standpipes, vents,
other piping systems, electrical conduit, outrigger beams, or
counterweights. This is the same requirement as was proposed in
paragraph (e)(3)(i) of the NPRM and is consistent with the
corresponding language in &#167; 1926.451(i)(8) of the existing rule.</p>

<p>Paragraph (g)(3)(ii) of the final rule states that horizontal
lifelines, when used, shall be secured to two or more structural
members of the scaffold, and shall not be attached only to the
suspension ropes. This is the same requirement as was proposed in
paragraph (e)(3)(ii). It is designed to provide protection to the
employee in the event of a suspension line failure.</p>

<p>Paragraph (g)(3)(iii) of the final rule provides that, when lanyards
are connected to horizontal lifelines or structural members on a
single-point or two-point adjustable suspension scaffold, the scaffold
must be equipped with additional independent support lines and
automatic locking devices capable of stopping the fall of the scaffold
in the event one or more of the suspension ropes fail. The independent
support lines must be equal in number and strength to the suspension
ropes. This is the same requirement as proposed paragraph (e)(3)(iii).
OSHA believes that in the event of a suspension rope failure, the
additional support lines will keep the scaffold from falling.</p>

<p>Paragraph (g)(3)(iv) of the final rule provides that vertical
lifelines, independent support lines, and suspension ropes must not be
attached to each other, or be attached to or use the same point of
anchorage, or be attached to the same point on the scaffold or body
belt/harness system. This is essentially the same provision as
proposed paragraph (e)(3)(iv), except that the requirements in the
final rule also prohibit the attachment of lines and ropes "to the
same point on the scaffold or personal fall arrest system." This
language reflects the incorporation of the note that accompanied
proposed paragraph (e)(3) into paragraph (g)(3)(i) of the final rule,
as discussed above.</p>

<p>Issue 19 in the preamble to the proposed rule noted that some
single-point adjustable suspension scaffolds which are currently in
use have two separate lines (one serves as an independent support
line) attached to two separate anchor points; however, both lines are
connected to a single point on the body support system. A failure of
this single body support mechanism, or body support system, could
result in an uncontrolled fall for the employee. OSHA sought comments
on the question of whether the final rule should permit the use of
such a system. The Agency also asked what criteria would need to be
set to ensure that a single mechanism or body support system prevented
failures. In addition, OSHA inquired about industry experience with
this type of system.</p>

<p>Several commenters (Exs. 2-29, 2-312, 2-367, and 2-368) and the
ACCSH (Tr. 6/9/89, pp. 150-151) were in agreement that OSHA should not
permit the use of systems of the type described in Issue 19. One
commenter (Ex. 2-29) stated simply that "the standard should not allow
single-point suspension scaffolds with two separate support lines to
be connected to a single point on the body support system."</p>

<p>The SSFI (Ex. 2-367) recommended "that OSHA not permit the use of a
lifeline and support line being tied to a single mechanism or body
support system. It is our opinion that the lifeline should be an
independent anchorage with independent support." Also, the SIA (Ex.
2-368) stated:</p>

<p>We are opposed to the use of systems in which the lifeline and
support line connect to a single mechanism or body support system. The
primary suspension line and an independent fall arrest system should
each be anchored to separate body support devices, so that in the
event one line fails, the other will provide protection. The cost
would be equal to the cost of the original suspension, but could be
negligible in many instances.</p>

<p>After a careful review of the comments, OSHA has determined that the
purpose of having separate lines would be defeated if lines were
attached to a single point at either end and that point of attachment
failed, and the final rule (paragraph (g)(3)(iv)) reflects this
determination.</p>

<p>Final rule paragraph (g)(4) sets criteria for guardrail systems used
to provide fall protection for employees working on scaffolds. These
provisions are consistent with the corresponding language of recently
revised subpart M of this part, Fall protection, except as necessary
to address the particular circumstances of construction work performed
from scaffolds.</p>

<p>Paragraph (g)(4)(i) of the final rule provides that guardrail
systems be installed along all open sides and ends of platforms. This
requirement is effectively the same as proposed paragraph (e)(4)(i)
and existing &#167; 1926.451(a)(4). OSHA has added language which clarifies
when guardrails would need to be in place. In the case of suspended
scaffolds, guardrails must be installed before any employee is allowed
on a hoisted scaffold. In the case of supported scaffolds,
installation must occur before employees are permitted to work from
the scaffold. When an employee is on a supported scaffold during the
scaffold erection process, fall protection is covered by final rule
paragraph (g)(2). This clarification is based on language in the State
of California Code, Title 8, paragraph 1637(i)(6) which was submitted
to the docket by the California Department of Industrial Relations
(Ex. 2-23).</p>

<p>Paragraph (g)(4)(ii) of the final rule provides that the top edge
height of toprails or equivalent members on supported scaffolds
manufactured or placed into service after January 1, 2000 must be
between 38 inches (0.97 m) and 45 inches (1.2 m) above the platform
surface. Furthermore, the top edge height of guardrails on supported
scaffolds manufactured and placed into service before January 1, 2000
and on all suspended scaffolds where both a guardrail and a personal
fall arrest system are required must be between 36 inches (0.9 m) and
45 inches (1.2 m). The final rule also provides that toprail height
may exceed 45 inches if the other criteria of paragraph (g)(4) have
been satisfied.</p>

<p>In the proposal, paragraph (e)(4)(ii) proposed a toprail height
between 38 and 45 inches above the platform surface when the guardrail
is the sole means of providing fall protection, and a toprail height
between 36 and 45 inches when the guardrail is used in conjunction
with a personal fall arrest system. The proposed minimum 36-inch
toprail height reflected OSHA's belief that the minimum height
requirement for a guardrail used with personal fall arrest systems
should be less than that for a guardrail on which employees rely for
fall protection.</p>

<p>As discussed in the proposed rule (51 FR 42690), the 38-inch lower
limit on guardrail height was proposed in lieu of the 39-inch lower
limit on guardrail height allowed by subpart M (Fall protection) to
allow for guardrail height differentials caused by scaffold platform
unit arrangements. In particular, a frame constructed to hold a
toprail 42 inches above a flush-mounted prefabricated deck would be
only 40 inches above a scaffold platform made with two-inch solid sawn
planks. If the scaffold planks are overlapped to form a long platform,
the guardrail height would drop to 38 inches.</p>

<p>In addition, the Agency has determined that employers should have
the flexibility, when conditions warrant, to use toprails with heights
higher than 45 inches, so long as the other protective criteria of
paragraph (g)(4) are satisfied. The language of the proposed rule has
been revised to reflect this flexibility. The language of paragraph
(g)(4)(ii) of the final rule is consistent with the corresponding
language in &#167; 1926.502(b)(1), Fall protection (subpart M).</p>

<p>Issue 12 of the preamble to the proposed rule sought comments on
whether OSHA should adopt the language in the 1977 edition of ANSI
A10.8-1977, paragraph 3.3, which sets 36 inches above the work
platform as the minimum guardrail height and on the effectiveness,
feasibility and cost savings of requiring guardrails to be at least 36
inches high. Issue 12 noted that existing &#167; 1926.451(a)(5), which
requires that guardrails be "approximately" 42 inches high, has been
interpreted over the years by OSHA to allow a range of 36 inches to 45
inches above the work platform. These interpretations, dating from
1979, are based on OSHA Program Directive #200-67 (Revision 1), issued
on October 24, 1978, and later renumbered as OSHA Instruction CPL
2.11A. OSHA notes that the 1988 edition of the pertinent ANSI
standard, A10.8-1988, paragraph 4.5.1, accepts toprails that are
installed between 36 and 45 inches above lower levels.</p>

<p>OSHA received many comments on the issue of guardrail heights (Exs.
2-9, 2-12, 2-13, 2-20, 2-21, 2-29, 2-41, 2-50, 2-53, 2-54, 2-55, 2-64,
2-69, 2-367, 2-368, 2-390, 2-476, and Tr. 6/9/87, pp 116-121). The
comments received ranged from those stating that 36 inches was too low
for the bottom of the range, that 36 inches was appropriate, that 45
inches was too high for the top of the allowable range of guardrail
heights, and that no change should be made to the range allowed by
existing OSHA interpretations (i.e., that allowable heights be between
36 and 45 inches above the work platform). The arguments presented by
the commenters are summarized below, along with OSHA's response to
these comments and the Agency's reasoning in reaching a final
determination on the matter.</p>

<p>Several commenters (Exs. 2-9, 2-20, 2-21, 2-50, 2-53, 2-55, 2-64,
2-69, 2-367, 2-368, 2-390, and 2-476) argued for retention of 36
inches as the minimum guardrail height. The reasons given by these
commenters were that "no accident statistics justify changing the
current range existing in OSHA standards" (Ex. 2-368), that 36 inches
is adequate or reasonable (Exs. 2-21, 2-53 and 2-69), that the height
is practical, feasible, and would not incur unmeasurable costs (Ex.
2-64), and that 36 inches is current industry practice (Exs. 2-367 and
2-476). Typical of these comments was the comment of the SIA (Ex.
2-368):</p>

<p>Guardrails on scaffolds are designed as a perimeter warning for
workers confined to small working areas. Workers do not attain body
motion speeds and momentum that require the drastic changes proposed.</p>

<p>Doctoral papers and NBS studies used as a basis for the proposals do
not deal with the "real" world. Dummies propelled against a guardrail
do not represent a true comparison of a human being with sense and
reflex ability.</p>

<p>Guardrails for scaffolds, whether they be horizontal systems or
crossbrace systems have historically been considered a perimeter
indication. Work is performed in localized areas where movement is
generally restricted from section to section. Workmen are not
subjected to the hazard of "momentum" created by body movement over
longer distances as in the case in peripheral railings or balconies
and other crowded or congested areas where body weight and force may
be accelerated * * *</p>

<p>It is apparent that guardrails of most manufacturers will fall
within the proposed 38-inches to 45-inches range. However, there are
many in the stream of commerce, and widely used throughout industry,
which will not. As an example, the GKN Kwikform scaffold system
utilizes a post with guardrail attachment points every 37 1/2". This
distance is based on the European standard spacing of one meter
[approximately 39 inches]. There is no justification for outlawing the
equipment which has been used safely for decades. It is more practical
to retain the 36-inches to 45-inches range permitted in the various
industry and ANSI standards.</p>

<p>The SSFI (Ex. 2-367) agreed with the SIA, stating as follows:</p>

<p>The majority of scaffold guardrail posts, manufactured in this
country since 1950, has been designed and manufactured to ANSI A10.8
Standard of 36" to 42" guardrail heights. The elimination of the lower
36-inch limit would result in the requirement to scrap all these posts
and remanufacture new posts.</p>

<p>The cost to replace guardrail units would be very expensive to the
user. In 1983, we estimated that there were at least one million
guardrail units being used. Retrofit changes at that time were
estimated at &#36;4 per unit or a total of &#36;4,000,000. Replacement costs
at &#36;10 per unit would equal &#36;10 million.</p>

<p>In response to this group of commenters, OSHA notes that the absence
of accident statistics substantiating the need for higher guardrails
reflects on the general inadequacy of occupational injury and illness
recording and reporting systems but may well have little or nothing to
do with guardrail heights and their relationship with fall hazards. It
is OSHA's experience that few accident reports contain the detail that
would be necessary to differentiate between the relative
protectiveness of guardrail heights of 36 as opposed to 38 or 39
inches. In addition, although guardrails do function as perimeter
indicators, they also provide fall protection, and it is this aspect
of scaffold guardrails that is of concern in final rule paragraph
(g)(4)(ii). Further, although "[d]ummies propelled against a
guardrail" (Ex. 2-368) cannot precisely mimic the responses and
movement of real workers in the actual work environment, the
experiments dismissed by the SIA provide valuable information that
cannot be disregarded by OSHA or other safety professionals.</p>

<p>OSHA recognizes the merit of the SIA and SSFI arguments about
industry's use of scaffold components (e.g., posts) suitable for
36-inch guardrails (Exs. 2-367 and 2-368), although the Agency also
notes that the &#36;4 to &#36;10 per scaffold unit cost for retrofit or
replacement, respectively, would not be prohibitive even for the
smallest scaffold-using business. Nevertheless, to respond to these
concerns, the final rule grandfathers those guardrails manufactured to
meet the 36-inch minimum height allowed by OSHA for many years and
still accepted by ANSI A10.8-1988. The Agency concludes that allowing
the continued use of these guardrails until they are replaced will
eliminate any potentially adverse impact of the final rule's
determination as regards minimum guardrail heights.</p>

<p>Many commenters (Exs. 2-12, 2-13, 2-29, 2-41, 2-54, 2-407, and Tr.
6/9/87, pp 116-121) share OSHA's concern, as stated in the preamble,
that a minimum guardrail height of 36 inches is insufficiently
protective. For example, one commenter (Ex. 2-407) stated:</p>

<p>[T]he guardrail height requirement should be set from 38-inches to
45-inches with a midrail. Our experienced opinion has taught us that
36-inches would be very unsafe. Especially for taller person[s]. * * *
As the industry has been set at 42" for so many years we feel that the
38" to 45" all inclusive would be satisfactory to cover the 42" which
so many people would now have, thus creating no additional expense.</p>

<p>Two other commenters (Exs. 2-29 and 2-41) also expressed concerns
about the adequacy of 36 inch high guardrails for tall employees, as
did Lawrence Stafford, a member of both the ANSI A10.8 Committee and
the SIA, who commented (Ex. 2-13)</p>

<p>I and many other members of S.I.A. do not consider 36-inches as safe
for all scaffold uses. Due to the narrow width of the platforms on
suspended scaffolds, the outboard sides should be protected by a
42-inch high guardrail.</p>

<p>Arguing in the same vein, a representative of OSHA's Advisory
Committee on Construction Safety and Health (June 9, 1987 meeting)
stated: "I think, if anything, people are getting bigger, not smaller.
To leave something down at 36 inches only increases the hazard to the
fellow working on a suspended scaffold where he needs a much as he can
get * * *" Another representative said that a 36-inch high guardrail
"strikes you in the wrong place * * * He goes over the rail or he
backs up to it while he's doing some work, it hits him at the wrong
point and he's gone." (Tr. 6/9/87, pp. 116-121).</p>

<p>Based on a review of the comments submitted on this issue, the
Agency's experience in enforcing this requirement over the years, and
OSHA's professional judgment, the final rule allows employers to
position scaffold guardrails in the range of 38 to 45-inches on
supported scaffolds, as proposed. This range is also consistent with
the guardrail criteria set in the revised standard (subpart M) for
Fall protection. However, OSHA recognizes that plank overlap is a
legitimate reason to accept a somewhat lower guardrail height on some
scaffolds. Thus, although the record indicates that most scaffolds on
the market fall within the 38- to 45-inch range (Ex. 2-368), some
scaffolds have been manufactured to meet the 36-inch lower guardrail
height limit accepted by ANSI. To allow the manufacturers of these
scaffolds the necessary time to redesign their systems, the Agency is
grandfathering 36-inch guardrail heights on all scaffolds manufactured
and installed before January 1, 2000. These scaffolds may continue to
be used throughout their normal service life, as long as they continue
to meet the other requirements of subpart L.</p>

<p>Final rule paragraph (g)(4)(iii), which is effectively identical to
proposed paragraph (e)(4)(iii), states that, when midrails, screens,
mesh, intermediate vertical members (such as balusters), solid panels,
or equivalent structural members are used, they are to be installed
between the top edge of the guardrail system and the scaffold
platform. This is essentially the same requirement as existing
&#167; 1926.451(a)(5), except that the existing language mentioned only
midrails and provided for the use of midrails "when required." In the
final rule OSHA has revised the existing language to reflect the
variety of options available and to express the Agency's intent
clearly.</p>

<p>Final rule paragraphs (g)(4)(iv) through (vi) (proposed as
paragraphs (e)(4)(iv)-(vi)) specify the criteria necessary to ensure
that the midrails, screens, mesh, and baluster type protection
required by paragraph (g)(4)(iii) will be properly placed and
effective. Paragraph (g)(4)(iv) requires that midrails, when used, be
installed at a height midway between the top edge of the guardrail
system and the platform surface. Paragraph (g)(4)(v) requires that
screens and mesh, when used, extend from the top edge of the guardrail
system to the scaffold platform, and along the entire opening between
the supports. Paragraph (g)(4)(vi) requires that intermediate vertical
members (such as balusters or additional rails), when used, be not
more than 19 inches (48 cm) apart.</p>

<p>The SSFI and SIA (Exs. 2-367 and 2-368) recommended the addition of
the word "approximately" to the midrail height required in paragraph
(iv). These commenters argued that, without the flexibility provided
by this word, the provision was unnecessarily restrictive and did not
properly address varying platform heights (such as where adjoining
platforms overlap) or the height variations allowed for toprails. OSHA
agrees that it is appropriate to allow for such variation, and the
final provision reflects this suggestion.</p>

<p>Paragraph (g)(4)(vii) of the final rule provides that toprails or
equivalent members be capable of withstanding, without failure, a
force applied in any downward or horizontal direction at any point
along their top edge of at least 100 pounds (445 n) for guardrail
systems installed on single-point adjustable suspension scaffolds and
on two-point adjustable suspension scaffolds, and at least 200 pounds
(890 n) for guardrail systems installed on all other scaffolds.</p>

<p>The strength criteria for guardrail systems on single-point
adjustable and two-point adjustable suspension scaffolds differ from
the criteria set for guardrails used on other types of scaffolds
because of the functions guardrails serve on these types of suspension
scaffolds. Fall protection on these suspension scaffolds is provided
by a combination of personal fall arrest systems (PFAS) and
guardrails, rather than by either guardrails or PFAS alone. Guardrails
on single-point adjustable and two-point adjustable suspension
scaffolds delineate the scaffold edge, restrain movement, provide
handholds, and prevent misstepping. A guardrail system can serve these
functions without having the strength that would be needed if the
guardrails were the primary means of providing fall protection.
Therefore, OSHA has set the minimum capacity for guardrail systems
used on single-point and two-point scaffolds at 100 pounds rather than
at 200 pounds.</p>

<p>This is the same substantive requirement as was proposed in
paragraph (e)(4)(vii); however, the language has been modified as
discussed above to replace the proposed terms "Type I" and "Type II"
guardrails with the pertinent performance criteria. One commenter (Ex.
2-44) recommended that the force requirements be changed to 100 pounds
for Type I toprails and 80 pounds for Type II toprails. OSHA has
maintained the proposed strength requirements, i.e., 100 pounds, for
all toprails because the Agency believes that they are necessary to
prevent employees from breaking through toprails if they fall against
them.</p>

<p>Final rule paragraph (g)(4)(viii) provides that when the loads
specified in paragraph (g)(4)(vii) are applied in a downward
direction, the top edge may not drop below the height above the
platform surface prescribed in paragraph (g)(4)(ii). Proposed
paragraph (e)(4)(viii) was identical to the corresponding requirement
in the final rule except that the proposal limited deflection to 38
inches on supported scaffolds (Type I guardrails) and 36 inches on
suspended scaffolds (Type II guardrails). The parallel final rule
provision does not contain the proposed guardrail designations, for
the reasons discussed above, and the provision also reflects minor
editorial changes.</p>

<p>Paragraph (g)(4)(ix) of the final rule states that midrails,
screens, mesh, intermediate vertical members, solid panels, and
equivalent structural members must be capable of withstanding, without
failure, a force applied in any downward or horizontal direction at
any point along the midrail or other member of at least 75 pounds (333
n) for guardrail systems with a minimum 100 pound toprail capacity,
and at least 150 pounds (666 n) for guardrail systems with a minimum
200 pound toprail capacity. Except for the changes in guardrail system
terminology discussed above, this provision is the same as proposed
paragraph (e)(4)(ix).</p>

<p>The 150 pound force requirement is not specified in the existing
standard. However, the existing requirements (e.g., &#167; 1926.451(b)(15) et
al.) require midrails to be made of 1 x 6-inch lumber (or other
material providing equivalent protection). The existing standard also
requires midrails to be not more than 8 feet long (&#167; 1926.451(a)(5)),
and to be made of a minimum 1,500 fiber stress construction grade
lumber (see &#167; 1926.451(a)(9)). On the average, such wooden midrails can
support loads up to approximately 160 pounds before breaking.
Therefore, OSHA is replacing the specific reference to 1 x 6-inch
lumber with the performance criterion of 150 pounds force. Similarly,
OSHA has adopted a performance criterion of 50 pounds for toeboards in
final rule paragraph &#167; 1926.451(f)(3).</p>

<p>The only commenter (Ex. 2-44) on this issue recommended that the
proposed force requirements be changed to 75 pounds for Type I and 40
pounds for Type II midrails. OSHA has not made this change because the
Agency believes that the final rule's strength requirements for
midrails are necessary to prevent employees from breaking through
midrails or other intermediate members of the guardrail system. In
addition, OSHA has not maintained the distinction between Type I and
Type II midrails made in the proposal.</p>

<p>Final rule paragraph (g)(4)(x) (proposed paragraph (e)(4)(x))
provides that a separate guardrail section is not required on the ends
of suspension scaffolds when the scaffold's support system (stirrup)
or hoist prevents passage of employees. One commenter (Ex. 2-8)
suggested that OSHA specify a maximum space of 10 inches between the
hoist or stirrup and the side guardrail or structure. Another
commenter (Ex. 2-28) suggested that the language of this paragraph be
changed from "does not allow passage" to "does not allow normal
passage without climbing over the stirrup." OSHA has not made the
suggested changes because this requirement is clear as written.</p>

<p>Paragraph (g)(4)(xi) (proposed paragraph (e)(4)(xi)) of the final
rule requires that guardrail systems be so surfaced as to prevent
injury to an employee from punctures or lacerations, and to prevent
the snagging of clothing. This provision is consistent with
&#167; 1926.502(b)(6), which sets criteria for guardrails used in
construction, other than on scaffolds.</p>

<p>The language of the final rule is effectively identical to that in
the proposed rule, except that the proposed rule contained the words
"which could cause an employee to fall." OSHA used those words to
explain that one reason that guardrail systems should have smooth
surfaces is to prevent snagging of clothing. OSHA did not intend by
this language to limit protection to those situations where snagging
would actually result in a fall. OSHA realizes that other hazards,
such as exposure to falling objects, could arise if an employee's
clothing snagged on a guardrail surface. In the final rule, OSHA has
revised the proposed language accordingly.</p>

<p>The SSFI and SIA (Exs. 2-367 and 2-368) objected to the inclusion of
this provision in the final rule. Both commenters stated that the
provision would be "impractical in the construction industry because
of the different types of equipment used," and would be
"unquestionably over-restrictive for the construction industry." The
SIA (Ex. 2-368) added "As worded, even the standard guardrail posts
could be considered hazardous." OSHA believes that this existing
requirement is still needed and is promulgating the proposed provision
as editorially revised. The Agency does not intend this provision to
be interpreted to mean that guardrail system components have sanded or
finished surfaces. Instead, OSHA intends that such surfaces be free of
breaks and jagged edges that could cause cuts or lacerations, or snag
employee's clothes.</p>

<p>Paragraph (g)(4)(xii) of the final rule, which is effectively
identical to proposed paragraph (e)(4)(xii), requires that toprails
and midrails not be so long as to constitute a hazard. This is
identical to the corresponding provision in subpart M, (Fall
protection) &#167; 1926.502(b)(7), and is intended to protect employees from
projection hazards.</p>

<p>Paragraph (g)(4)(xiii) of the final rule, which is identical to
proposed paragraph (e)(4)(xiii), prohibits the use of steel banding
and plastic banding as toprails or midrails. Although such banding can
often withstand a 200 pound load, it can tear easily if twisted. In
addition, such banding often has sharp edges which can cut a hand if
seized. This is identical to the corresponding provision in subpart M
(Fall protection), &#167; 1926.502(b)(8).</p>

<p>Paragraph (g)(4)(xiv) of the final rule requires that guardrail
systems using manila, plastic or synthetic rope as rails be inspected
by a competent person as frequently as necessary to ensure that the
guardrails comply with the performance criteria in final rule
&#167; 1926.451(g). This provision has been added based on the response to
Hearing Notice Issue L-10.</p>

<p>Issue L-10 sought testimony and related information on an ACCSH
recommendation (Tr. 212-214, 6/9/87) that the Agency bar the use of
manila rope and plastic rope as toprails and midrails of guardrail
systems used on scaffolds. This recommendation reflected ACCSH's
concern that manila rope and plastic rope can lose strength quickly
when exposed to water and sun.</p>

<p>The SIA (Exs. 5a-16 and 10, Tr. 3/22/99, pp. 160-161) disagreed with
this view on the grounds that it should not be necessary to restrict
the type of material that can be used because other provisions of the
standard spell out system strength requirements for guardrails.
Another commenter (Exs. 5a-3 and 13) agreed, noting that, particularly
for short-term use, "a rope is handy, adequate, and perfectly safe."
This commenter stated that these ropes "should not be barred from use
on scaffolds providing they are capable of supporting a 100-pound load
(Type II) or a 200-pound load (Type I) applied in any direction
without excessive deflection."</p>

<p>Zurn Industries (Ex. 2-81) commented that "plastic rope" should be
defined, but did not provide such a definition. Zurn also stated
"[t]here are synthetic ropes made of plastic materials that do not sag
or lose strength when exposed to water or sun." This commenter also
suggested applying performance language to all materials used for
guardrails since future technology might provide more advanced types
of plastic rope.</p>

<p>After carefully considering the above comments and testimony, OSHA
believes that it is not necessary to prohibit the use of manila,
plastic or synthetic rope as guardrails on scaffolds. The Agency
realizes that these types of ropes can deteriorate over time from
environmental exposure. However, the Agency also realizes that such
ropes can have a useful lifespan before significant deterioration
occurs. Consequently, OSHA is promulgating final rule
&#167; 1926.451(g)(4)(xiv), which allows the use of plastic, manila or
synthetic rope only on condition that such ropes be inspected as often
as necessary to ensure their integrity. This provision is consistent
with the approach taken in &#167; 1926.502(b)(16), which sets generic
performance criteria for guardrails used in construction.</p>

<p>Paragraph (g)(4)(xv) of the final rule permits the use of
crossbracing in lieu of either a midrail or a toprail when certain
criteria are met. This provision is based on responses to NPRM Issue
13 and the March 29, 1993, reopening of the record. In particular,
crossbracing would be accepted in lieu of a toprail when the crossing
point is between 38 and 48 inches above the work surface. Also,
crossbracing would be accepted in lieu of a midrail when the crossing
point is between 20 and 30 inches above the work surface. In addition,
the end points of each upright must be no more than 48 inches apart,
which will reduce the slope of the crossbracing and result in a
surface that is similar to that of a standard guardrail.</p>

<p>The Agency received over 30 comments in response to Issue 13 and
the March, 1993 reopening of the record on the issue of the use of
crossbracing in lieu of guardrails (Exs. 2-13, 2-14, 2-20, 2-22, 2-26,
2-29, 2-30, 2-37, 2-43, 2-54, 2-55, 2-128, 2-330, 2-367, 2-368, 2-390,
2-476, 34-1, 34-9, 34-10, 34-11, 34-12, 34-15, 34-17, 34-19, 34-22,
34- 29, 34-32, 34-34, 34-35, 34-37, 34-39, 34-43, 34-46, and Tr.
6/9/87, pp. 121-126). These comments are discussed below,</p>

<p>Issue 13 of the NPRM sought comments concerning whether OSHA should
accept crossbracing on intermediate levels of supported scaffolds as
an alternative to the existing and proposed rules requiring guardrail
systems on such levels. The Issue raised the question of whether
crossbraces are as effective as guardrail-type systems in preventing
falls, and asked for comments on two sets of provisions that had been
developed by the SIA and other interested industry groups.</p>

<p>Issue 13 presented the first three alternatives as a group
(hereafter Items 1(a)-(c)). Item 1(a) would have allowed crossbracing
in lieu of a midrail if the crossing point was at or between 20 and
32 inches above the work surface. Item 1(b) provided that crossbracing
would be allowed in lieu of both midrail and toprail if the crossing
point was at or between 30 and 48 inches above the work surface and
the end points of the uprights were 54 inches, or less, apart. Item
1(c) would have prohibited the use of crossbracing in lieu of a
toprail or midrail on the top level of a scaffold (Issue 13 repeated
this suggested provision as Item 2(c)).</p>

<p>Issue 13 also presented a second set of alternatives for
crossbracing (hereafter Items 2(a)-(d)). Item 2(a) provided that
crossbracing would be allowed in lieu of a toprail if the crossing
point was at or between 39 and 49 inches above the work surface and
the endpoints of the uprights were 54 inches, or less, apart. Item
2(b) provided that crossbracing would be allowed in lieu of a midrail
if the crossing point was at or between 20 inches and 30 inches above
the working surface. Item 2(d) would prohibit the use of crossbracing
in lieu of both the toprail and midrail on the same scaffold level at
the same time.</p>

<p>Commenters to Issue 13 were split into two groups: those supporting
(Exs. 2-14, 2-20, 2-22, 2-26, 2-30, 2-53, 2-55, 2-367, 2-368, 2-390,
and 2-476) and those rejecting (Exs. 2-13, 2-29, 2-37, 2-43, 2-54,
2-128, and ACCSH) the use of crossbracing in lieu of guardrails.</p>

<p>The ACCSH (Tr. 6/9/87, pp. 121-129) and six commenters (Exs. 2-13,
2-29, 2-37, 2-43, 2-54 and 2-128) opposed OSHA recognizing
crossbracing as a substitute for a standard guardrail. One commenter
(Ex.2-13 ) stated "that there is no substitute for the protection
afforded by a constant-height guardrail". The same commenter added
that "there is no industry standard to allow a substitution in that
the OSHA standards have required guardrail systems since 1971".</p>

<p>On the other hand, those commenters favoring crossbracing argued
that crossbracing should be allowed in lieu of the <b class="ITALICS">entire</b> guardrail
system (Exs. 2-14, 2-20, 2-26, 2-30, 2-55, 2-367, 2-368, 2-390, and
2-476), or that crossbracing should be permitted on intermediate levels
(Ex. 2-53), or that it should be permitted as a midrail only if the
midpoint of the "X" was 20 to 32 inches from the platform (Ex. 2-22).</p>

<p>Specifically, commenters in the group favoring crossbracing argued
that requiring guardrails in all situations could result in structural
instability (Ex. 2-14), was impractical, increased the likelihood of
accidents, could cause problems when attempting to attach guardrails
to the scaffold frame, and might raise issues of economic feasibility
(Ex. 2-368). Some of these commenters also argued that available
statistics did not support retention of the existing rule's
prohibition against the use of crossbracing in lieu of guardrails
(Exs. 2-20, 2-55, 2-367, 2-368, and 2-390).</p>

<p>For example, one commenter (Ex. 2-14) stated:</p>

<p>If cross braces and guardrail cannot be placed on the same studs,
and only toprails and midrails are used to connect a run of scaffold
frames other than the top run, a very hazardous structural situation
is created. This is due to the lack of triangulation which crossbraces
provide.</p>

<p>The SIA (Ex. 2-368) argued that:</p>

<p>Each time workers completed one level they would have to remove the
guardrail posts and rails, install frames and cross braces, plank the
next level, install guardrail posts and rails and repeat the procedure
at each level.</p>

<p>The increased work would create a greater possibility of accident
than that which it proposes to prevent.</p>

<p>The SIA also commented, argued that:</p>

<p>It is impractical and economically unfeasible to require
manufacturers to call in all their scaffolds for refurbishing. There
is no way the owners of scaffolds would comply nor any way the
manufacturer could force them to do so. The result would be a far
greater hazard due to alteration of the scaffold frames by persons not
qualified to perform the delicate welding required on steel scaffold.
It is further impossible when you consider the fact that there are
hundreds of thousands of separate owners of scaffold frames
manufactured by numerous manufacturers, many of which are no longer in
business.</p>

<p>The AGC (Exs. 2-20, 2-55, and 2-390) stated that crossbracing can be
used as an effective guardrail, because "studies do not reflect actual
field conditions and accident statistics do not reflect the need for
the existing standard." OSHA notes, however, that inadequate accident
statistics and that lack of detailed annotation about the details of
accidents that are reported should not be taken as evidence that no
relationship exists.</p>

<p>Based on its review of the above-discussed comments, OSHA decided
that more information was needed in order to determine if the Agency
should allow the use of crossbracing in lieu of guardrail top rails or
midrails. Accordingly, on March 29, 1993, OSHA reopened the public
record on subpart L (58 FR 16509) for additional input. In particular,
the Agency requested comments regarding the extent to which
supplemental rail systems could be used with crossbraces to meet the
guardrail requirements of subpart L.</p>

<p>The commenters to the Reopening of the record either agreed with or
opposed the use of crossbracing in lieu of a guardrail in about the
same proportions as the earlier commenters. Their comments, which are
closely related to those addressed by the earlier commenters on this
issue, are only briefly summarized below:</p>

<UL>
<p>--Those opposed to the use of crossbracing (Exs. 34-1, 34-11, 34-19,
34-22, 34-29, 34-34, and 34-35) argued that crossbraces would not
provide protection equivalent to that provided by standard guardrails,
because crossbracing lacks the uniform height and consistent spacing
between toprails and midrails that are found in guardrail systems and
are necessary for adequate protection (Ex. 34-11); because there are
variations in attachment heights, distances between crossmembers, and
the strength of the attachment points where crossbracing is used (Ex.
34-34); and because the use of crossbraces may promote shortcuts in
scaffold erection since employers might fail to measure the points of
the crossbracing or to add toeboards (Ex. 34-19). In addition, one
commenter stated that crossbraces should be supplemented by midrails
and toprails because employees may fall through the triangular void on
either side of the intersection of the braces, and added that
crossbraces may give a false sense of security (Ex. 34-35), and
another (Ex. 34-22) stated that commercial scaffolds are all capable
of being fitted with conventional guardrails, and that crossbraces
can, at best, only be used to replace either the toprail or midrail,
not both.</p>

<p>--Those supporting the use of crossbracing in lieu of guardrails
(midrail or toprail) urged OSHA to adopt certain height requirements
for the crossing points of the crossbracing. For example, five
commenters (Exs. 34-9, 34-10, 34-12, 34-17, 34-37) stated that
crossbracing could be substituted for a midrail as the crossing point
of the brace is between 20 and 31 inches above the work surface, while
others argued that crossbracing could be used in lieu of a toprail or
midrail if the crossing point fell in the range of 30 to 48 inches
above the working surface. Another group of participants (Exs. 34-9,
34-10, 34-12, and 34-17) were of the opinion that crossbracing
substituting for a midrail should have a crossing point in the 20-to
30-inch range. A large number of commenters (Exs. 34-9, 34-10, 34-12,
34-17, 34-32, 34-37, and 34-39) stated that end points of the
crossbraces must be no more than 54 inches apart.</p>
</UL>

<p>Another group of commenters (Exs. 34-5, 34-9, 34-10, 34-12, 34-17,
34-22, and 34-29) provided information on supplemental rail systems,
such as those produced by Waco, Safway or Nail. These commenters
stated that such systems are feasible and would provide protection
equivalent to guardrails that comply with proposed subpart L in
certain situations.</p>

<p>Donald Nail (Ex. 34-15) commented as follows:</p>

<p>* * * I have devised a way to enhance scaffold safety. The safety
rail which I invented can be conveniently attached to scaffold
crossbraces, thus eliminating the excuses of those employers and
employees who simply do not want to put them up.</p>

<p>This invention is not currently on the market due to resistance from
the scaffold and construction industries. If OSHA regulations were
changed to require a guardrail with scaffolding, employer compliance
would follow without undue economic hardship. The average cost would
be about &#36;5 (plus the rail) per frame as opposed to current systems
averaging &#36;30.</p>

<p>The basic concept for my automatic guard rail is that you cannot
erect a welded-frame scaffold without crossbraces. The automatic
guardrail would be permanently attached to the crossbraces with a
slide ring on each end of the rail . . . The guard rail will fold up
with the crossbraces when they are taken down for shipping or storage.
The crossbraces are easier and quicker to install with the guard rail
attached than without, not to mention safer. If the guard rail is
permanently attached to the crossbraces the workmen will have
installed the guard rails automatically, thereby helping to reduce
numerous fatalities and thousands of scaffold injuries each year.</p>

<p>However, commenters opposed to the use of supplemental rail systems
(Exs. 34-32, 34-37, and 34-39) argued that the Safway panel can only
be installed on walk-through frames that have attachment members on
both sides. They added that these systems were designed to be used in
cases where crossbracing is not required in every bay.</p>

<p>SIA (Ex. 34-37) commented that the Waco system has not been accepted
by industry because: (a) It can only be used on a specific type
scaffold frame; (b) It increases the number of pieces three-fold
because it also requires two additional rails; (c) It significantly
increases the dead load on the scaffold; (d) It has not proved to be
economically feasible. The commenter added that Patent Scaffolding Co.
has had a similar device consisting of four pieces for 10 years, but
that it has not been widely used for the same reasons.</p>

<p>In addition, the SIA contended that the Nails Safety Rails system is
not feasible because:</p>

<UL>
<p>(a) It is a proprietary system which cannot be used universally.</p>

<p>(b) It cannot be used with angle braces which account for 60&#37; of
most inventory.</p>

<p>(c) When attached to the crossbrace it becomes permanent (since it
is riveted on) and therefore, by its very nature must be used (with
the crossbrace) where it would not be required--thus adding
considerable more dead load to the scaffold.</p>

<p>(d) It requires another inventory item not usually included in
stock.</p>

<p>(e) It requires extra attachments to the scaffold frame.</p>

<p>(f) It creates costly maintenance problems when plaster and cement
hinder sliding the rail.</p>

<p>(g) It is not cost effective.</p>
</UL>

<p>The Agency finds that the supplemental railings discussed above can
be used as guardrails in some situations. However, these supplemental
systems are not compatible with all scaffolds, and will thus not
address the guardrail vs. crossbracing issue. In addition, based on
the determination, discussed above, that crossbracing can be used
safely in lieu of either a midrail or a toprail, but not both, the
Agency finds no reason to mandate the use of these supplemental
railings. Employers may still use these railing in situations where
they are appropriate to protect employees working on scaffolds from
fall hazards.</p>

<p>After carefully reviewing the extensive record on this issue, the
Agency has determined that it is appropriate to allow crossbracing in
lieu of a midrail <b class="ITALICS">or</b> a toprail (but not both). The crossing point
heights and crossbrace endpoint distance spelled out in the final rule
are based on a combination of those raised in Issue 13 of the NPRM and
those specified in the California code and reflect OSHA's evaluation
of the record as a whole.</p>

<p>OSHA disagrees that crossbracing can be used in lieu of both the
midrail and the toprail of a standard guardrail system. The principal
reasons for this determination are that the voids on each side of the
intersection of the crossbraces present a serious fall hazard to
employees working on scaffolds, and that the uneven height and spacing
of crossbraces also contribute to the fall hazard. For example, if
OSHA permitted crossbracing in lieu of both a toprail and a midrail,
the voids below the crossing point of the crossbrace could be as high
as 48 inches. This would be inconsistent with good safety practice and
with subpart M of this part (Fall protection), which requires that
openings in walls or other vertical surfaces not exceed 30 inches in
height unless a guardrail is installed. In addition, Review Commission
decisions (see, for example, 10 OSHRC 1937 and 7 OSHRC 1951) have
consistently upheld OSHA's position that crossbracing is not
equivalent to a guardrail in the degree of protection provided.
Support for the position taken in the final rule also comes from
California, where the State Code initially allowed the use of
crossbracing in lieu of a guardrail system but was changed in 1976 to
limit the use of crossbracing as only a midrail or a toprail, but not
both. A review of California's experience shows that permitting the
use of crossbracing in lieu of either a midrail or a toprail has not
compromised employee safety. Washington State and Arizona both allow
such use of crossbracing; OSHA notes that these three states together
account for well over 10 percent of all U.S. construction work. In
addition, specifics of the California code agree with those in the
final rule. For example, California accepts crossbracing as a toprail
if the intersection of the "X" occurs at 45 inches (+/-3 inches).
Issue 13 suggested a range of 39 to 49 inches for the height of the
crossing point, and the final rule accepts a range of 38 to 48 inches
to reflect the lower limit of guardrail height permitted by this final
subpart L, and the upper limit permitted by the California code.</p>

<p>In addition, the final rule specifies that the end points of each
upright be no more than 48 inches apart, not 54 inches as suggested by
many commenters and raised in NPRM Issue 13. This spacing (48 inches)
is consistent with the California code and will reduce the slope of
the crossbracing and result in a flatter surface that is more
consistent with that of a standard guardrail, and will provide
equivalent protection.</p>

<p>The Agency has concluded that crossbracing where the crossing point
is between 20 and 30 inches can serve safely as a midrail since the
use of a standard top rail will provide the uniform height that the
Agency has determined is necessary, while the use of a toe board will
limit the size of any openings (voids) on either side of the crossing
point.</p>

<p>Similarly, OSHA believes that where the crossing point occurs in the
38- to 48-inch range the crossbracing must be supplemented by a
midrail. Otherwise, an opening as high as 48 inches could occur,
allowing an employee to fall. These conditions would also occur if
crossbracing were permitted to be used in lieu of a complete standard
guardrail. Accordingly, the final rule contains provisions allowing
use of crossbraces as a substitute for either the midrail or toprail,
but not both, providing that the crossing point and end point
distances specified in the final rule are observed.</p>

<p><b class="ITALICS">Paragraph 1926.451(h). Falling object protection.</b></p>

<p>This paragraph addresses the protection of employees from
scaffold-related falling object hazards. Paragraph (h)(1) of the final
rule provides that employees working on scaffolds wear hardhats and be
protected from falling hand tools, debris, and other small objects
through the installation of toeboards, screens, or guardrail systems
or through the erection of debris nets, catch platforms, or canopy
structures that deflect falling objects. In addition, when the falling
objects to which employees on scaffolds may be exposed are too large,
heavy or massive to be contained or deflected by any of the
above-listed measures, the employer must protect affected employees by
placing any such potential falling objects away from the edge of a
surface from which they might fall and must secure those materials as
necessary to prevent their falling.</p>

<p>This provision is similar to proposed paragraph (f)(1), which was
based on existing &#167;&#167; 1926.451(a)(16) and (h)(13). OSHA has added
the phrase "hand tools, debris, and other small" to describe the
type and size of objects that OSHA expects would be handled by
toeboards, screens, guardrails, canopies, debris nets and catch
platforms. In addition, the Agency has added language which requires
that employers place materials away from an edge over which they might
fall and secure those objects as necessary to prevent their falling,
if those materials are so large, heavy or massive that the
above-listed measures would not contain or deflect them. The changes
that have been made to this requirement since the proposal are based
on comments received from the SSFI and the SIA (Exs. 2-367 and 2-368)
indicating that "compressors, marble, pipe, large bolts, etc. could
be potentially falling objects" and that it is unreasonable to
require guarding against such large objects.</p>

<p>OSHA agrees that the protective measures required by the proposed
paragraph would not be adequate to withstand large objects. For
example, a slab of marble facing would smash through screens or
guardrails if it had not been properly stored and retained. In fact,
an object of this mass would probably crash through a debris net or
even a catch platform or protective canopy. As provided by the final
rule, the appropriate way to protect affected employees from such
large items is to locate those items away from the edge and to secure
them to keep them from falling.</p>

<p>Because objects falling from scaffolds may injure employees working
below, final rule paragraph (h)(2) requires employers to protect
affected employees from that hazard and sets forth several alternative
means by which employers can provide the required protection. The
provisions of proposed paragraph (f)(2) were identical, except that
debris nets and catch platforms have been added to the final rule,
because, based on review of the rulemaking record, OSHA considers such
measures to be acceptable alternatives.</p>

<p>Paragraph (h)(2)(i) provides for the use of barricades on lower
levels to exclude employees from areas where falling objects might
land. Compliance with this new provision will enable employers to
eliminate employee exposure to the hazard.</p>

<p>Under paragraph (h)(2)(ii), employers would be required to provide
toeboards along the edge of platforms more than ten feet above lower
levels for a distance sufficient to protect workers below, except that
on float (ship) scaffolds, an edging of 3/4 inch x 1 1/2 inch
wood, or a material with equivalent strength, may be used in lieu of a
toeboard. This provision differs from existing &#167; 1926.451(a)(4),
which requires toeboards to be erected along the entire length of all
open sides and ends of all scaffolds more than 10 feet high. The final
rule, like proposed paragraph (f)(2)(ii), requires toeboards only
where needed to protect employees below from falling object hazards.</p>

<p>For example, on a long scaffold where employees are working on the
ground near one end of the scaffold, compliance with this provision
would require the scaffold to have a toeboard at the end over the
employees below, but not at the other end. This would be the case
regardless of the height of the scaffold work platform. This change
recognizes that toeboards and equivalent members are for the
protection of employees below. Accordingly, if no employees are
exposed, no protective measures are necessary.</p>

<p>Paragraph (h)(2)(iii) of the final rule provides, as an alternative,
for erection of paneling or screening in cases where tools or other
materials are piled to a height higher than the top edge of a
toeboard. The panel or screen must extend from the toeboard (or
platform) to the top of the guardrail and be erected for a distance
sufficient to protect employees below. In addition, the panel or
screen would need to be capable of withstanding, without failure, a
force of at least 150 pounds, applied in any downward or outward
direction at any point along the screen (to comply with paragraph
(g)(4)(ix)). This provision is effectively identical to proposed
paragraph (f)(2)(iii). The proposed rule referenced the proposed
&#167; 1926.502 criteria for screens, while the final rule directly
incorporates the applicable strength requirement from &#167; 1926.502(b)(5),
Fall protection (subpart M). OSHA believes that this revision will
facilitate compliance by eliminating the need for employers to look up
a cross reference.</p>

<p>Paragraph (h)(2)(iv) of the final rule allows employers to protect
employees from falling objects through the installation of a guardrail
system which complies with &#167; 1926.451(g)(4) and which has openings small
enough to reject passage of potential falling objects. This provision
is identical to proposed paragraph (f)(2)(iv).</p>

<p>Paragraph (h)(2)(v) of the final rule provides that employers can
protect employees working below scaffolds from falling objects through
the installation of debris nets, catch platforms, or canopies that
have sufficient strength to withstand the impact forces of potential
falling objects.</p>

<p>In contrast to final rule paragraph (h)(2)(v), proposed paragraph
(f)(2)(v) provided only for the use of a canopy structure. OSHA has
added debris nets and catch platforms to this provision in response to
the statement by Bristol Steel (Ex. 5a-3) that debris nets or catch
platforms immediately below a scaffold could be more protective than a
canopy many feet below. The Agency agrees that properly installed
debris nets and catch platforms in place immediately below a scaffold
will stop objects from falling closer to the source, and will lessen
the possibility that these falling objects will pick up momentum and
bounce off the canopy, injuring workers some distance from the area
below the scaffold.</p>

<p>Hearing Notice Issue L-13 sought testimony and comments on a
suggestion by the ACCSH (Tr. 6/9/87, 214-15) that proposed
&#167; 1926.451(f)(2)(v) specify nine feet as the proper height for the
placement of a canopy. The ACCSH noted that the proposed requirement
did not specify a height for canopy placement. According to the ACCSH,
a canopy set at 15 or 20 feet would not protect employees below.
However, the Advisory Committee did not provide a supporting rationale
for its position.</p>

<p>Both the SIA (Exs. 10 and 5a-16, and Tr. 3/22/88, pp. 162-163) and
SSFI (Ex. 5a-19) supported the placement of the canopy at a height of
10 feet. The SIA pointed out that standard scaffold frames are
six-feet high and adding a three-foot frame would raise the canopy
top, including the plank, to a height of almost 10 feet. The SIA
suggested that OSHA specify a "maximum" distance of 10 feet, noting
that the proposed standard would not have allowed for any variation to
accommodate these standard frames. The SSFI's comment stated that
canopies "should be erected no greater than 10 feet above the work
surface" and that because the intent of this requirement was to
provide employee protection from small falling objects and/or light
debris, "the term `reasonable' should be included within the
definition." In addition, the SSFI asked what anticipated impact
forces such canopies would be required to withstand.</p>

<p>The National Chimney &#38; Cooling Tower Association (Ex. 2-593)
indicated that no height restriction was appropriate for canopies. The
commenter stated that restricting the height would severely hamper
equipment access. Bristol Steel (Ex. 5a-3) supported allowing maximum
flexibility for designing various types of falling object protection
for varying situations. This commenter stated that there should be no
limitation on canopy height as long as the canopy functions as
intended.</p>

<p>After carefully considering the comments and testimony received in
response to this issue, OSHA believes that specifying a maximum height
for canopy placement could unnecessarily restrict the use of
equipment. In addition, the Agency believes that the use of
performance-oriented language, requiring that canopies be strong
enough to withstand the impact forces of potential falling objects,
will ensure employee safety and at the same time provide the
flexibility necessary to respond adequately to advances in technology
as well as unusual or changing work-site conditions. The employer is
responsible for determining the maximum size of potential falling
objects and providing the appropriate protection.</p>

<p>Final rule paragraph (h)(3) sets criteria for the use of canopies.
Paragraph (h)(3)(i) of the final rule, which is identical to proposed
paragraph (f)(1)(i), requires that canopies be installed between the
falling object hazard and the employees. Paragraph (h)(3)(ii) of the
final rule, which is identical to proposed paragraph (f)(1)(ii),
requires the use of additional independent support lines to support
the scaffold in the event of suspension support rope failure, in cases
where canopies are used for falling object protection on suspended
scaffolds. The reason for this requirement, as stated in the
discussion of final rule paragraph (g)(3), is that in the event of a
suspension rope failure, the additional lines would keep the scaffold
from falling.</p>

<p>Paragraph (h)(3)(iii) of the final rule, which is identical to
proposed paragraph (f)(1)(iii), requires that independent support
lines and suspension ropes not be attached to the same point of
anchorage. This new provision will prevent the loss of the backup
safety systems in the event of suspension rope anchorage failure.</p>

<p>Final rule paragraph (h)(4) sets strength criteria for toeboards.
Paragraph (h)(4)(i), which is a new requirement, requires that
toeboards be capable of withstanding, without failure, a force of at
least 50 pounds applied in any downward or horizontal direction at any
point along the toeboard. This provision contains a note which
indicates that toeboards built in accordance with Appendix A of
subpart L will be deemed to comply with the standard. This provision,
which is consistent with the corresponding requirement in OSHA's Fall
Protection standard, &#167; 1926.502(j)(2) (subpart M), is identical to
proposed paragraph (f)(3)(i).</p>

<p>Final rule paragraph (h)(4)(ii) sets forth the construction
requirements for toeboards. This provision requires that toeboards be
at least three and one-half inches high, fastened securely in place,
and have not more than 1/4-inch clearance above the walking/working
surface. In addition, toeboards must be solid or have openings no
greater than one inch in the greatest dimension. This provision, which
is consistent with the corresponding requirement of the Fall
Protection standard, &#167; 1926.502(j)(3) (subpart M), is identical to
proposed paragraph (f)(3)(ii), except as discussed below.</p>

<p>OSHA received one comment on proposed paragraph (f)(3)(ii). That
commenter (Ex. 2-29) recommended a maximum space of 1/4-inch between
the lower edge of the toeboard and the platform instead of the
proposed 1/2-inch on the grounds that "many small tools and fastener
materials can pass through a 1/2-inch opening." OSHA agrees that
reducing this opening will enhance employee protection and has changed
the language of the final rule accordingly.</p>

<p><b class="ITALICS">Other Issues Related to 1926.451</b></p>

<p>Issue L-7 of the hearing notice solicited testimony and related
information on the extent to which proposed &#167; 1926.451 ("General
requirements") adequately covers smokestack hoist scaffolds. The
Agency also requested testimony and information on stack hoist hazards
not addressed by the general requirements, and explained that the
issue was being raised in light of ongoing efforts to update ANSI
standard A10.22, Safety Requirements for Rope Guided and Non-Guided
Workmen's Hoists. OSHA noted that the final rule might need to include
provisions to address the hazards unique to stack hoist scaffolds.
However, because stack hoist scaffolds are included in the definitions
of "scaffold" and "suspension scaffold" used in the scaffold rules,
OSHA concludes that the final rule does not need to include specific
coverage for stack hoist scaffolds. OSHA notes that, since the
proposal, the ANSI A10.22-1977 standard for stack hoist scaffolds has
been rescinded and has not been replaced.</p>

<p><b class="ITALICS">1926.452 Additional Requirements Applicable to Specific Types of Scaffolds</b></p>

<p>Section 1926.452 of the final rule contains requirements that
supplement the requirements of &#167; 1926.451 with regard to particular
types of scaffolds. The identified scaffolds have unique features
which require specific attention. This approach is consistent with
that taken in existing &#167; 1926.451 (b) through (y), which set out
additional provisions for specific types of scaffolds.</p>

<p>OSHA received comments (Exs. 2-13 and 2-23) which suggested that
specific scaffold design criteria and fall protection requirements be
added to proposed &#167; 1926.452 (particularly to proposed paragraphs (i),
(l), (m), (q), (r), (s), (t), (u) and (v)). OSHA has determined that
compliance with the performance-oriented provisions of final rule
&#167;&#167; 1926.451 and 1926.452, taken together, will provide adequate
protection for employees working on scaffolds. Further, the Agency
believes that the specification language suggested by the commenters
would limit innovation and impose unreasonable burdens on employers.</p>

<p>As discussed in the preamble to the proposed rule (51 FR 42691-6),
many existing &#167; 1926.451 requirements are not being carried forward in
final rule 1925.452 because the topics they address (capacity,
construction, access, fall protection and falling object protection)
are covered by provisions in final rule &#167; 1926.451. The provisions being
reordered are presented in Table 1, which shows the requirement in
OSHA's existing rule and the corresponding provision in the final rule
being published today.</p>

<p>Paragraph (a) Pole Scaffolds</p>

<p>Final rule paragraph (a) sets requirements for the proper use of bearers,
braces and runners on pole scaffolds. The corresponding provision in existing
&#167; 1926.451(b) is titled "Wood pole scaffolds." The final rule has deleted the
word "wood" from the title of the paragraph, since pole scaffolds can be
constructed of other materials. In addition, the final rule provides that
pole scaffolds over 60 feet in height be designed by a registered
professional engineer, and must be constructed and loaded in accordance with
that design. The provision also notes that non-mandatory Appendix A contains
examples of criteria that will enable an employer to comply with design and
loading requirements for pole scaffolds under 60 feet in height. These
provisions are virtually identical to those in the proposal, except for minor
editorial revisions for the sake of clarity, as discussed below. In addition,
as illustrated by Table 2, many existing &#167; 1926.451(b) requirements are being
carried forward in paragraph (a) of &#167; 1926.452 of the final rule.</p>

<p>OSHA received three comments (Exs. 2-13, 2-367 and 2-368) on proposed
&#167; 1926.452(a). The SSFI (Ex. 2-367) recommended that OSHA change the term
"Ledger" to "Runners" because "Runners" is the correct terminology. OSHA
agrees and has incorporated that change into paragraph (a) of the final rule.</p>

<p>The other commenters (Exs. 2-13 and 2-368) objected to the proposed deletion
of the word "wood" from the title of this paragraph, stating that this
section refers only to wood pole scaffolds. OSHA believes that all pole
scaffolds, whatever their composition, need to be covered by the criteria of
proposed paragraph (a) and, accordingly, has not made the suggested change.</p>

<p>Finally, the Agency has editorially revised the text of final rule
1296.452(a)(10) to clarify that non-mandatory Appendix A contains examples of
criteria that will enable an employer to comply with design and loading
requirements for pole scaffolds under 60 feet in height, and that pole
scaffolds over 60 feet in height must be designed by a registered
professional engineer. This revision highlights the fact that the proposed
criteria and now the final rule criteria in non-mandatory Appendix A are
limited to heights of less than 60 feet.</p>

<p>Paragraph (b) Tube and Coupler Scaffolds</p>

<p>Paragraph (b) sets requirements for the use of bearers, bracing, runners and
couplers on tube and coupler scaffolds. In addition, the final rule provides
that tube and coupler scaffolds over 125 feet in height be designed by a
registered professional engineer, and be constructed and loaded in accordance
with such design. The provision also notes that non-mandatory Appendix A
contains examples of criteria that will enable an employer to comply with
design and loading requirements for tube and coupler scaffolds under 125 feet
in height. These provisions are virtually identical to the proposed
provisions, except as discussed below.</p>

<p>Final rule paragraph (b)(1), which is identical to the corresponding
provision of the proposed rule, is a new requirement for tube and coupler
scaffolds. This provision requires that platforms not be moved until the next
location has been properly prepared to support the platform being moved. This
is the same requirement as existing &#167; 1926.451(b)(14) (final rule
&#167; 1926.452(a)(1)) for wood pole (pole) scaffolds. This rule was added to this
section because it addressed the problem of platform stability during
construction, a problem which exists for tube and coupler scaffolds as well
as pole scaffolds.</p>

<p>Paragraph (b)(2) of the final rule requires the installation of transverse
bracing at the scaffold ends and, at least, at every third set of posts
horizontally and every fourth post vertically. This paragraph provides for
diagonal bracing from the outer or inner posts or runners upward to the next
outer or inner posts or runners. In addition, building ties must be installed
at the bearer levels between the diagonal braces in conformance with
&#167; 1926.451(c)(1). This provision is consistent with existing &#167; 1926.451(c)(10).</p>

<p>This requirement differs from the proposed paragraph (b)(2), which required
transverse bracing to be installed for each section of six levels between the
fourth and sixth level.</p>

<p>The SSFI and the SIA (Exs. 2-367 and 2-368) recommended that transverse
bracing be installed at the base and be repeated every third and fourth level
vertically, and that building ties be installed "at bearer levels adjacent to
the bracing" (Ex. 2-367), or at "the bearer levels between the diagonal
brace[s]" (Ex. 2-368). In support of the suggested change, the SIA (Ex.
2-368) stated "[t]his revision would correct the inaccuracy which has existed
for years in the current standard and will conform to proper engineering
criteria." Another commenter (Ex. 2-15) pointed out that the proposal did not
require transverse bracing at the base of the scaffold. In addition, a
commenter (Ex. 2-42) recommended that transverse bracing be installed at the
scaffold ends and at least at every third set of posts, that such bracing be
installed on every level and that it extend diagonally from the inner or
outer posts or runners.</p>

<p>OSHA has determined that the proposed bracing specifications would not
provide adequate structural stability for tube and coupler scaffolds. In
particular, OSHA has concluded that bracing at the third and fourth levels,
as suggested by the SSFI and the SIA and as provided in ANSI A10.8-1988,
paragraph 8.11, will provide appropriate stability. On the other hand, the
Agency believes that bracing at every level would be unnecessarily
burdensome, perhaps even affecting the capacity of the scaffold. Therefore,
OSHA is returning to the approach taken by existing &#167; 1926.451(c)(10). The
Agency has concluded that compliance with the suggested provisions will
increase scaffold stability appropriately and has revised the final rule to
reflect this finding. In addition, OSHA has drafted the final provision to
indicate clearly that the placement of building ties must comply with final
rule &#167; 1926.451(c)(1) (proposed as &#167; 1926.451(b)(13)).</p>

<p>Paragraph (b)(3) of the final rule, which is basically the same as the
proposed paragraph, is based on existing &#167; 1926.451(c)(11). This provision sets
requirements for the installation of longitudinal bracing across the inner
and outer rows of posts for straight run scaffolds. In particular, such
bracing must be installed diagonally in both directions and shall extend from
the base of the end posts upward to the top of the scaffold at a 45 degree
angle. Where scaffold length is greater than height, bracing shall be
repeated at least at every fifth post. Where scaffold length is less than
height, such bracing shall be installed from the base of the end posts upward
to the opposite end posts and then in alternating directions until reaching
the top of the scaffold. In addition, bracing shall be installed as close as
possible to the intersection of the bearer and post or of the runner and
post. The proposed provision was identical, except that it did not specify
that only straight run scaffolds were covered or that the bracing had to be
installed as close as possible to a post's intersection with bearers or
runners.</p>

<p>The SSFI and the SIA (Exs. 2-367 and 2-368) suggested that OSHA limit
application of the proposed provision to straight run scaffolds and that the
Agency specify the proximity of bracing to the intersection of posts with
bearers or runners. The Agency believes that limiting the provision to
straight run scaffolds is appropriate, since when a tube and coupler scaffold
is installed around circular structures or at corners, the inside leg is
braced in the direction perpendicular to the walkway (platform) because the
runners come in at less than 180 degrees. In addition, OSHA agrees that it is
appropriate to include requirements regarding where to position bracing, and
the final provision has been written accordingly. (Bracing requirements for
those tube and coupler scaffolds that are not straight run scaffolds are
found in final rule &#167; 1926.451(c).) Paragraph (b)(4) of the final rule requires
that bracing be attached to the runners as close to the post as possible,
where conditions preclude attachment of bracing to posts. This provision is
basically the same as the proposed provision, which was based on existing
&#167; 1926.451(c)(11). OSHA has modified this provision based on comments from the
SSFI and the SIA (Exs. 2-367 and 2-368) which suggested that "as close to the
post as possible" be added to the end of this paragraph. The Agency
recognizes that attachment to the post, while the most desirable option, is
not always possible. In circumstances where such attachment is not possible,
OSHA has determined that attachment to the runner, as close as possible to
the post, will still maximize directional stability and provide the strength
necessary to properly brace the scaffold.</p>

<p>Paragraphs (b)(5) through (b)(10) of the final rule are identical to
corresponding provisions of the proposed rule, except for some minor
editorial revision to paragraph (b)(10). As explained in the preamble to the
proposed rule (51 FR 42691), these provisions are based on existing &#167;&#167; 1926.451
(b) and (c).</p>

<p>Paragraph (c) Fabricated Frame Scaffolds</p>

<p>Paragraph (c) of the final rule provides additional requirements for
fabricated frame scaffolds (tubular welded frame scaffolds). Two commenters
(Exs. 2-13 and 2-320) recommended that OSHA retain the title, "Tubular Welded
Frame Scaffolds" used in the existing rule. As discussed above in reference
to the definitions in &#167; 1926.450(b), however, OSHA has not followed this
suggestion but has retained the existing title in parentheses after the new
title. Paragraph (c) of the final rule is virtually identical to the
corresponding provision in the proposal except as discussed below.</p>

<p>Paragraph (c)(1) of the final rule is a new requirement for fabricated frame
scaffolds. It requires that platforms not be moved until the next location is
properly prepared and ready to support the platform being moved. This
provision is necessary to ensure that the scaffold is positioned on a level
and stable surface, as discussed for final rule &#167; 1926.451(b)(1), above.</p>

<p>Final rule paragraphs (c)(2), (c)(3) and (c)(6), which are identical to the
corresponding proposed paragraphs, are effectively identical to existing
&#167;&#167; 1926.451(d)(3), (5) and (9), respectively.</p>

<p>Final rule paragraph (c)(4), which is identical to the parallel provision of
the proposed rule, requires the locking together of end frames, and is
essentially the same as existing &#167; 1926.451(d)(6). This requirement only
applies where uplift forces are strong enough to displace the end frames or
panels, such as when a hoist is being used that could snag the scaffold
during a hoist operation.</p>

<p>Final rule paragraph (c)(5) specifies the proper placement of platform
support brackets. Improper placement of such cantilever supports can
significantly reduce their support capacity and thus endanger employees
working on top of the platform. Proposed paragraph (c)(5) set seating
requirements for brackets and required that brackets not be bent or twisted
from those positions. This provision of the final rule is identical except
that it also allows the use of bracket systems to support loads other than
employees only where the system has been designed and built to withstand the
tipping forces imposed by those other loads.</p>

<p>OSHA received comments from the SSFI and the SIA (Exs. 2-367 and 2-368)
suggesting that such brackets be allowed for the support of personnel but not
for the storage or support of materials. Based on those comments, Issue L-8
of the hearing notice solicited testimony and supporting information
regarding the revision of proposed &#167; 1926.452(c)(5) to require that side
brackets on fabricated frame scaffolds "* * * be used to support personnel
only and shall not be used for storage or support of materials." OSHA also
indicated that, in the Agency's opinion, this area would be adequately
covered by proposed &#167; 1926.451(a)(1), which sets capacity requirements, and
proposed &#167; 1926.451(d)(1), which prohibits overloading.</p>

<p>The SIA (Exs. 5a-16 and 10) stated that, since users may not know the load
capacities of their side brackets without consulting a loading table, they
may unintentionally overload the units. The SIA explained that "employees
tend not to respect the dangers involved" with side bracket loads, which
"induce an eccentric load and overturning propensity on the scaffold system."
They further noted that the "aisle" provided by a series of side brackets is
typically 20 inches wide, which provides insufficient room for employees to
step around stored material. The SIA testimony (Tr. 3/22/88, p. 160) repeated
these concerns but added that bracket systems properly designed to take loads
other than workers should not be prohibited by the final rule.</p>

<p>Bristol Steel (Exs. 5a-3 and 13) stated that proposed &#167; 1926.451(a)(1) and
(d)(1) would adequately address the SIA and SSFI concerns, and therefore did
not support the suggested additional language.</p>

<p>After carefully considering the above-described comments, OSHA has
determined that fabricated frame scaffolds which utilize bracket systems must
be used only to support personnel, unless the scaffold has been designed for
other loads by a qualified engineer and been built to withstand the tipping
forces caused by the loads being placed on the bracket supported section of
the scaffold. The final rule reflects this determination (paragraph
(c)(5)(iii)). OSHA believes that compliance with this requirement will
provide employees working on fabricated frame scaffolds with the protection
they need while working on this type of scaffold.</p>

<p>Paragraph (d) Plasterers', Decorators' and Large Area Scaffolds</p>

<p>(d) of the final rule requires that plasterers', decorators' and large area
scaffolds be constructed in accordance with &#167; 1926.452(a), (b), or (c) of this
section. This requirement is identical to that in the proposed rule.
Paragraph (d) references the provisions of paragraphs (a), (b), and (c)
because plasters', decorators' and large area scaffolds are almost always
constructed using pole scaffolds, tube and coupler scaffolds, or fabricated
frame scaffolds. The existing rule, &#167; 1926.451(q)(1), required that the
scaffolds in question be built only according to the existing rules for pole
scaffolds. OSHA believes that compliance with the provisions of &#167; 1926.452(a),
(b) or (c) will provide appropriate protection for employees covered by
paragraph (d).</p>

<p>Paragraph (e) Bricklayers' Square Scaffolds (Squares)</p>

<p>Paragraph (e) provides additional requirements for bricklayers' square
scaffolds (squares). This paragraph requires that scaffolds made of wood be
reinforced with gussets on both sides of each corner (paragraph (e)(1)); that
diagonal braces be installed on all sides of each square (paragraph (e)(2));
that diagonal braces be installed between squares on the rear and front sides
of the scaffold, and extend from the bottom of each square to the top of the
next square (paragraph (e)(3)); and that scaffolds of this type not exceed
three tiers in height, that they be constructed and arranged so that one
square rests directly above the other, and that the upper tiers stand on a
continuous row of planks laid across the next lower tier and be nailed down
or otherwise secured to prevent displacement (paragraph (e)(4)). These
requirements are identical to those in the proposed rule.</p>

<p>Final rule paragraphs (e)(1), (2), and (3) contain essentially the same
requirements as existing &#167;&#167; 1926.451(n)(3) and (4), except that the specific
requirements for the size of the member are being replaced by the capacity
requirements of &#167; 1926.451(a)(1). OSHA notes that non-mandatory Appendix A of
this final rule provides examples of component dimensions for bricklayers'
square scaffolds that would be deemed to comply with &#167; 1926.451(a)(1). Final
rule paragraph (e)(4) contains the same requirement as existing
&#167; 1926.451(n)(6).</p>

<p>Paragraph (f) Horse Scaffolds</p>

<p>Paragraph (f) provides additional requirements for horse scaffolds. This
paragraph requires that horse scaffolds not be constructed or arranged more
than two tiers or 10 feet (3.0 m) in height, whichever is less (paragraph
(f)(1)); when arranged in tiers, that each horse be placed directly over the
horse in the tier below (paragraph (f)(2)); when arranged in tiers, the legs
of each horse shall be nailed down or otherwise secured to prevent
displacement (paragraph (f)(3)); and that, when arranged in tiers, each tier
shall be crossbraced (paragraph (f)(4)). These requirements, which are
identical to the parallel provisions of the proposed rule, correspond to
existing &#167;&#167; 1926.451(o)(1), (o)(4) and (o)(5), respectively.</p>

<p>Paragraph (g) Form Scaffolds and Carpenters' Bracket Scaffolds</p>

<p>Paragraph (g) of the final rule, which is effectively unchanged since the
proposal, provides additional rules for form scaffolds and carpenters'
bracket scaffolds. Under the existing standard, carpenters' bracket scaffolds
and form scaffolds are addressed separately (existing &#167;&#167; 1926.451(m) and (x),
respectively). However, OSHA has determined that the two types are so similar
that it is appropriate to address them in a single paragraph.</p>

<p>Final rule paragraph (g)(1) carries forward the requirements for attachment
of a scaffold to a supporting framework or structure set by existing
&#167; 1926.451(m)(2), (x)(4)(ii), and (x)(5).</p>

<p>Paragraph (g)(2), in turn, maintains the existing &#167; 1926.451(x)(6)(i)
requirement that wooden bracket form scaffolds be an integral part of the
form panel. Paragraph (g)(3), like existing &#167; 1926.451(x)(5)(i), requires that
folding type metal brackets, when extended for use, shall be either bolted or
secured with a locking-type pin.</p>

<p>Paragraph (h) Roof Bracket Scaffolds</p>

<p>Paragraph (h) of the final rule provides additional requirements for roof
bracket scaffolds. This paragraph requires that scaffold brackets be
constructed to fit the pitch of the roof and provide a level support for the
platform (paragraph (h)(1)); and that brackets be anchored in place by nails
unless it is impractical to use nails (paragraph (h)(2)). Paragraph (h)(2)
further provides that brackets shall be held in place with first-grade manila
rope of at least three-fourth inch diameter, or a rope with equivalent
strength, when nails are not used. These provisions are essentially identical
to the corresponding proposed provisions and to existing &#167; 1926.451(u)(1) and
(u)(2), respectively.</p>

<p>Existing &#167; 1926.451(u)(3) requires the installation of catch platforms below
the working area of roofs more than 16 feet from the ground and having a
slope greater than 4 inches in 12 inches without a parapet. This provision
also requires that the platform extend at least 2 feet from the eaves and
that employees be protected from falls by a guardrail system unless employees
are using personal fall arrest systems. The existing provision is being
replaced by the general fall protection requirements of &#167; 1926.451(g). The
final rule, like the proposal, allows guardrails on roof bracket scaffolds to
be mounted on a catch platform or be attached to the eaves. Therefore, the
Agency has concluded that there is no need to mention catch platforms in this
provision. OSHA has determined that it is appropriate to allow employers
flexibility in choosing where to attach guardrails. The Agency notes that a
catch platform is an elevated work platform that meets the definition of a
scaffold and therefore must comply with the pertinent provisions of this
final rule.</p>

<p>Paragraph (i) Outrigger Scaffolds</p>

<p>Paragraph &#167; 1926.452(i) of the final rule provides additional requirements for
outrigger scaffolds. Except for editorial changes, as noted below, the
requirements of the final rule are identical to those of the proposed rule.
Paragraphs (i)(1) through (i)(4), which set requirements for the proper
positioning and securing of outrigger beams, are consistent with existing
&#167; 1926.451(g)(1). Some editorial changes have been made to proposed paragraph
(i)(2), as suggested by a commenter (Ex. 2-64), in order to clarify OSHA's
regulatory intent that the supporting beam be used in its strongest
orientation. Paragraphs (i)(5) and (i)(6), which require that the inboard
ends of outrigger beams be securely anchored and that the entire supporting
structure be securely braced, respectively, are effectively identical to
existing &#167; 1926.451(g)(2). Proposed paragraph (i)(5) has undergone minor
editorial changes since the proposal: the existing provisions have been
broken down into their component parts to facilitate compliance.</p>

<p>Final rule paragraph (i)(7), which is identical to the corresponding
requirement in the proposed rule, requires that platform units be nailed,
bolted or otherwise secured to outriggers, to prevent displacement. The
corresponding language in existing &#167; 1926.451(g)(4) required simply that
planking be secured to the beams. OSHA believes that the revised language
better expresses the Agency's intention that employers use effective means
when securing platform units to outrigger beams.</p>

<p>Paragraph (i)(8) requires that scaffolds and scaffold components be designed
by a registered professional engineer and constructed and loaded in
accordance with such design. This provision has been revised to reflect
OSHA's determination that the design of this type of scaffold involves
calculations that required the skills of a registered professional engineer,
and that the criteria in the proposed rule had such limited applicability as
to be of virtually no help to employers in almost all situations. The
proposed rule was based on existing &#167; 1926.451(g)(3).</p>

<p>Paragraph (j) Pump Jack Scaffolds</p>

<p>Paragraph &#167; 1926.452(j) of the final rule provides additional rules for pump
jack scaffolds. Paragraph (j)(1) requires that pump jack brackets, braces,
and accessories be fabricated from metal plates and angles. In addition, each
pump jack bracket shall have two positive gripping mechanisms to prevent any
failure or slippage. This provision is identical to the proposed paragraph
and to existing &#167; 1926.451(y)(2).</p>

<p>Paragraph (j)(2) requires that poles be secured to the structure by rigid
triangular bracing or equivalent, at the bottom, top, and other points as
necessary. In addition, that provision further requires that when the pump
jack has to pass bracing that is already installed, an additional brace must
be installed approximately four feet (1.2 m) above the brace to be passed.
That additional brace must be left in place until the pump jack has been
moved and the original brace reinstalled. These requirements, which are
identical to the proposed paragraph except for an editorial revision, are
essentially the same as existing &#167;&#167; 1926.451(y)(4)(iii) and (iv).</p>

<p>NPRM Issues 9 and 22 asked for comments about whether OSHA should remove the
requirement for bottom braces on pump jack scaffolds. One commenter (Ex.
2-13) stated that from his experience, * * * "no one uses any but the top
pole brace." Another commenter (Ex. 2-31) agreed with this assessment,
saying, in part, "[i]n terms of common practice, the bottom brace is
virtually nonexistent. In terms of practicality, homeowners do not permit
holes made in their foundation." This same commenter continued that "[i]n
terms of functions, the bottom brace does not relieve the pole from
breaking," and added as follows:</p>

<p>There exists the misconception that a pumpjack pole will shoot out when a
load is applied to it. Fact is, the greater the load, the greater the
anchorage. Our in plant testing is done with no brace securement. This, along
with my 10 years plus of field inspections, substantiates the unreality of a
bottom brace. More accidents would be experienced from tripping over bottom
braces; and eye accidents from securement to concrete. Overwhelmingly, the
bottom brace simply does not belong. When a wooden pumpjack pole is used,
&#167; 1926.451(a)(1) can better be achieved with mid-bracing. The location of a
pumpjack on a pole is not a true fulcrum point. That is an erroneous
assumption that precedes the pole pulling away from the wall at the bottom
assumption.</p>

<p>NIOSH recommended (Ex. 2-40) bracing or securing the bottom of pump scaffold
columns "in some manner at all times." NIOSH stated that if "the employer
chooses to brace in a different manner than suggested by the [existing]
regulations, then the method used must be shown to be equivalent to that
required by the regulations."</p>

<p>Another commenter (Ex. 2-54) stated the "bottom brace should remain for
poles, [because that part of the scaffold] is the one part that is easiest to
hit and move." The commenter added that the "bottom brace seems like the one
that is needed the most * * *" After reviewing this issue, the ACCSH also
recommended that the requirement for a bottom brace be retained (Tr. 6/9/87,
pp. 95-96).</p>

<p>Based on its review of the comments, OSHA has determined that employers do
need to brace the bottom of the support pole to keep it in place, but that it
is not necessary to specify the use of a rigid triangular bottom brace. Other
methods, such as anchoring the pole to the ground, would provide equivalent
support. Therefore, the final rule requires, as did the proposal, that
pumpjack poles be braced at the bottom by triangular bracing or equivalent
means.</p>

<p>A commenter (Ex. 2-52) stated that "[a] requirement for braces every ten
vertical feet has been eliminated. Insofar as the same applies to wooden
poles, we believe this requirement should be maintained in the Regulations."
OSHA is aware that existing &#167; 1926.451(y)(4)(i) provides for 10 foot spacing of
poles (center to center) when wood scaffold planks are used as platforms for
pump jack scaffolds. That paragraph further provides that pole spacing may
exceed 10 feet center to center when fabricated platforms are used that fully
comply with all other provisions of existing paragraph (y). The Agency
proposed to delete existing paragraph (y)(4)(i) because OSHA believed that
compliance with the capacity requirements of proposed &#167; 1926.451 (a)(1) would
provide adequate assurance that a pump jack scaffold was structurally sound
and able to hold the anticipated loads. As indicated above, the Agency
believes that it is appropriate to focus on the capacity of the scaffold, not
on the exact spacing of the braces, when evaluating the adequacy of a
particular pump jack scaffold. Accordingly, OSHA has not made the suggested
change.</p>

<p>That commenter also stated "The explanation for additional bracing is
confusing. We believe the phrase `on the side opposite the brace from the
pump jack' should read: `above the brace to be passed'." OSHA agrees that the
suggested language, which appears in existing &#167; 1926.451(y)(4)(iv), more
clearly expresses the Agency's intent, and this is reflected in the final
rule at paragraph (j)(2).</p>

<p>Paragraph (j)(3) provides, when guardrails are used for fall protection,
that a workbench may be used as the toprail only if the workbench complies
with the requirements of &#167;&#167; 1926.451(g)(4)(ii), (vii), (viii) and (xiii). This
provision is effectively identical both to the proposed provision and to
existing &#167; 1926.451(y)(12).</p>

<p>Paragraph (j)(4) provides that work benches shall not be used as scaffold
platforms. This provision, which is identical to the corresponding provision
of the proposed rule, is effectively identical to existing &#167; 1926.451(y)(13).</p>

<p>Paragraph (j)(5) provides, when poles are made of wood, that the pole lumber
shall be straight-grained, free of shakes, large loose or dead knots, and
other defects which might impair strength. This provision, which is unchanged
from that in the proposed rule, is based on existing &#167; 1926.451(y)(6). OSHA has
deleted existing specification language which addressed the dimensions and
type of wood to be used, because OSHA believes that wood poles which comply
with the performance requirements of final rule &#167; 1926.451(a)(1) will provide
adequate protection for affected employees.</p>

<p>Paragraph (j)(6) provides, when wood poles are constructed of two continuous
lengths, that the lengths shall be joined together with the seam parallel to
the bracket. This provision, which is unchanged from the corresponding
provision of the proposed rule, is based on existing &#167; 1926.451(y)(7). The
Agency has deleted the existing specification language, which addressed the
dimensions of the wood to be used and the means of joining, because OSHA
believes, again, that compliance with &#167; 1926.451(a)(1) will provide adequate
protection for affected employees. The Agency notes that the language in
question has been included in non-mandatory Appendix A to provide an example
of how an employer could comply with &#167; 1926.451(a).</p>

<p>Final rule paragraph (j)(7) requires, when two by fours are spliced to make
a pole, that mending plates be installed at all splices to develop the full
strength of the member. This provision differs from the proposed requirement
because it requires mending plates at splices. Proposed paragraph (j)(7)
required that splices be constructed to develop the full strength of the
member, but did not require mending plates.</p>

<p>NPRM Issue 9 asked whether proposed paragraph (j)(7) should require mending
plates on all spliced wooden poles. One commenter (Ex. 2-13) wanted the
Agency to prohibit the splicing of wood poles used for pump jack scaffolds.
His explanation was that:</p>

<p>[t]here is no splice that can equal the strength of the total pole cross
section. Wood pole lengths should be limited to commercially available
lengths.</p>

<p>From my experience, at work sites across this nation, no one uses any but
the top pole brace. All the more reason to eliminate splicing to gain added
pole lengths.</p>

<p>The same commenter added "[t]he vast majority of the accidents involving
pump jack scaffolds are caused by pole failure at a splice".</p>

<p>Another commenter (Ex. 2-31) said that a mending plate addresses the typical
way a wooden pole breaks, i.e., laterally. He added that in-house tests
conducted by his firm showed that poles with the plates are three times
stronger than those without them, and went on to say that the cost factor for
plate use is negligible. The ACCSH also recommended that mending plates be
used on all splices (Tr. 6/9/87, pp. 95-96).</p>

<p>Based on its review of the comments and its knowledge of pumpjack scaffolds,
OSHA has determined that mending plates provide an appropriate increase in
the strength of spliced poles, and final rule paragraph (j)(7) reflects this
determination. OSHA also believes that requiring wood poles to be made
entirely of one piece of wood (i.e., no splices) would not be realistic
because many contractors use this type of scaffold and splices with mending
plates are at least as strong as unspliced wood. Although OSHA is aware that
splices are potential weak points in a pole, the Agency finds that mending
plates provide assurance that the spliced pole has adequate strength.</p>

<p>Several commenters (Exs. 2-23, 2-31 and 2-52) suggested that the final rule
include the general requirements applicable to pump jack scaffolds found in
this section of OSHA's existing scaffold standard. However, the final rule
sets out general requirements for all scaffolds, including pump jack
scaffolds, in &#167; 1926.451, and OSHA has therefore not made the suggested change.</p>

<p>Paragraph (k) Ladder Jack Scaffolds</p>

<p>Paragraph &#167; 1926.452(k) of the final rule provides additional requirements for
ladder jack scaffolds. Paragraph (k)(1) provides that platforms shall not
exceed a height of 20 feet (6.1 m). This provision, which is identical to
that in the proposed rule, is based on existing &#167; 1926.451(s)(1) and current
safe industry practice.</p>

<p>Paragraph (k)(2) requires that all ladders used to support ladder jack
scaffolds meet the requirements of subpart X of 29 CFR part 1926--Stairways
and Ladders, except that job-made ladders, which are permitted by subpart X,
are not permitted to be used to support ladder jack scaffolds. This
provision, which is identical to the parallel requirement in the proposed
rule, is consistent with existing &#167; 1926.451(s)(2). The existing standard
referenced two national consensus standards which, as subsequently updated,
have been incorporated into the pertinent provisions of subpart X. In
particular, existing &#167; 1926.451(s)(2) implicitly prohibited the use of
job-built ladders.</p>

<p>Two commenters (Exs. 2-20 and 2-55) opposed the proposed prohibition on the
use of job-made ladders as ladder jack scaffold support, and stated that
job-made ladders constructed according to proposed &#167; 1926.1053 (subpart X)
could serve as adequate supports for ladder jack scaffolds. However, OSHA
concludes, based on the record and the Agency's experience in the
construction industry, that job-made ladders that comply with the
requirements of &#167; 1926.1053 may not be able to support the heavy point loading
imposed by ladder jack scaffold brackets. OSHA has therefore determined that
the use of a job-made ladder to support a ladder jack scaffold could lead to
scaffold collapse, and the final rule reflects this finding. OSHA's final
rule is thus consistent on this point with the position taken by the
corresponding ANSI standard, A10.8-1988, paragraph 17.2.2, which provides
that only manufactured ladders may be used to support ladder-type scaffolds
or platforms.</p>

<p>Paragraph (k)(3) provides that the ladder jack be so designed and
constructed that it will bear either on the side rails and ladder rungs or on
the ladder rungs alone. This paragraph further requires that the bearing area
for a ladder jack that bears only on the rungs shall be at least 10 inches
(25.4 cm) on each rung to ensure adequate support. This provision, which is
identical to that in the proposed rule, is effectively identical to existing
&#167; 1926.451(s)(3).</p>

<p>Paragraph (k)(4) requires that ladders used to support ladder jacks be
placed, fastened, or equipped with devices to prevent slipping. This
provision, which is identical to that in the proposed rule, is effectively
identical to existing &#167; 1926.451(s)(4) and is intended to prevent employee
falls caused by displacement of the ladder.</p>

<p>Paragraph (k)(5) provides that scaffold platforms shall not be bridged one
to another. This paragraph, which is identical to the proposed requirement,
is a new requirement that is intended to ensure the stability of the system
and to prevent accidental overloading. The provision would prohibit
situations where, for example, four ladders are used to support three
platforms. OSHA is prohibiting bridging because this practice often leads to
overloading of the two ladders in the middle. This provision does not
prohibit passage from one scaffold to another if the scaffolds are close
enough for employees to walk (but not to jump or swing) from one scaffold to
the other.</p>

<p>Three commenters [Exs. 2-23, 2-367, and 2-368] urged OSHA to include
specific language in the final rule addressing acceptable dimensions and
loading of ladder jack scaffolds. OSHA has not made the suggested revisions
because the Agency believes that the capacity requirements found in final
rule &#167; 1926.451(a) adequately address these matters.</p>

<p>Another commenter (Ex. 2-308) recommended that ladder jack scaffolds be
prohibited because they "cannot be secured at the top," safe access is not
possible, and an anchorage for attaching a lifeline or lanyard is not
available. Although the Agency agrees that the conditions described by this
commenter may occur in some construction situations, they are not
characteristic of ladder jack scaffolds per se. Employers using ladder jack
scaffolds must still comply with the applicable general requirements of
&#167; 1926.451, such as those addressing capacity, access and fall protection,
i.e., the three situations mentioned by the commenter. In particular,
employees working on ladder jack scaffolds must be protected from fall
hazards by personal fall arrest systems which comply with the criteria set in
subpart M, &#167; 1926.502(d) (Fall protection) (final rule &#167; 1926.451(g)(1)(ii)).
Ladder jack scaffolds which do not comply with those requirements must not be
used.</p>

<p>Based on the rulemaking record and the Agency's own experience, OSHA has
determined that ladder jack scaffolds used in compliance with the
requirements of the final rule provide acceptable and safe working surfaces
for employees. Accordingly, the final rule does not prohibit the use of
ladder jack scaffolds.</p>

<p>Paragraph (l) Window Jack Scaffolds</p>

<p>Paragraph (l) of the final rule provides additional requirements for window
jack scaffolds. This paragraph provides that window jack scaffolds shall be
securely attached to the window opening (paragraph (l)(1)), shall be used
only for the purpose of working at the window opening through which the jack
is placed (paragraph (l)(2)) and shall not be used to support planks placed
between one window jack and another, or to support other elements of
scaffolding. These requirements are necessary to ensure the safety of
employees working from these platforms.</p>

<p>These provisions of the final rule are identical to the corresponding
proposed provisions. Paragraph (l)(1) is a new requirement, and is intended
to ensure that the scaffold is not accidentally displaced. Final rule
paragraphs (l)(2) and (l)(3) are identical to existing &#167;&#167; 1926.451(t)(1) and
(t)(2), respectively.</p>

<p>Paragraph (m) Crawling Boards</p>

<p>Paragraph (m) of the final rule provides additional requirements for
crawling boards (chicken ladders). The final rule requires that crawling
boards extend from the roof peak to the eaves when used in connection with
roof construction, repair, or maintenance (paragraph (m)(1)), and that
crawling boards be secured to the roof by ridge hooks or by means which
satisfy equivalent criteria (e.g., strength and durability) (paragraph
(m)(2)). These requirements are designed to ensure that crawling boards used
by employees performing roof work are as secure as possible.</p>

<p>The provisions of the final rule, which are effectively identical to those
of the proposed paragraph, are based on requirements in existing
&#167;&#167; 1926.451(v)(1) and (3), respectively. The other provisions of existing
&#167; 1926.451(v)(1) are being relocated to non-mandatory Appendix A since they
have been replaced by the capacity requirements of revised &#167; 1926.451(a)(1).
The existing rule's requirement to clinch nails has been deleted because the
inaccessibility of many nail points makes clinching impossible. Existing
&#167; 1926.451(v)(2) is being replaced by the fall protection requirements of
revised &#167; 1926.451(e)(1).</p>

<p>Paragraph (n) Step, Platform, and Trestle Ladder Scaffolds</p>

<p>Paragraph (n) of the final rule provides additional requirements for step,
platform, and trestle ladder scaffolds. The provisions of final rule
paragraph (n) are virtually identical to the provisions of the proposed
paragraph.</p>

<p>Paragraph (n)(1) provides that scaffold platforms not be placed any higher
than the second highest rung or step of the ladder supporting the platform.
This provision is consistent with paragraphs 17.4 and 17.5 of ANSI
A10.8-1988, and is intended to ensure the stability of this type of scaffold.</p>

<p>Paragraph (n)(2) requires that all ladders used in conjunction with step,
platform and trestle ladder scaffolds meet the requirements of subpart X of
29 CFR part 1926--Stairways and Ladders, except that job-made ladders must
not be used to support such scaffolds. A commenter (Ex. 2-23) suggested that
ladders used in conjunction with step, platform and trestle ladder scaffolds
be required to comply with subpart X or with the pertinent ANSI standards.
The commenter also suggested that OSHA prohibit the use of job-made ladders
to support such scaffolds. Final rule paragraph (n)(2), which is identical to
the proposed paragraph, addresses both of these concerns.</p>

<p>Paragraph (n)(3) provides that ladders used to support step, platform, and
trestle ladder scaffolds shall be placed, fastened, or equipped with devices
to prevent slipping. Paragraph (n)(4) requires that scaffolds not be bridged
one to another. Bridging, as discussed above under paragraph (k)(5), occurs
when four ladders are used to support three platforms. OSHA is prohibiting
bridging because this practice often leads to overloading of the two ladders
in the middle. Although step, platform and trestle ladder scaffolds were not
specifically addressed in OSHA's existing scaffold rule, they are covered by
the general requirements in existing rule &#167; 1926.451(a).</p>

<p>Final rule paragraphs (n)(2), (3), and (4) correspond to the ladder jack
scaffold provisions in final rule &#167;&#167; 1926.451(k)(2), (4) and (5), respectively.
The "ladder-type" scaffolds covered by paragraph (n) differ from ladder jack
scaffolds in that the platform rests directly on the ladder step or rung,
whereas ladder jack scaffold platforms rest on brackets.</p>

<p>Paragraph (o) Single-point Adjustable Scaffolds</p>

<p>Paragraph (o) provides additional requirements for single-point adjustable
scaffolds. This paragraph combines existing &#167; 1926.451(k), single-point
adjustable suspension scaffolds, and &#167; 1926.451(l), boatswains' chairs, because
boatswains' chairs are a form of single-point adjustable suspension scaffold.
One commenter (Ex. 2-23) opposed the combining of these paragraphs from the
existing rule because they [boatswains' chairs and other single-point
adjustable scaffolds] "have different requirements because of the different
positions in which the rider rides." OSHA has determined, however, that the
characteristics of single-point adjustable suspension scaffolds and
boatswains' chairs are sufficiently similar so that the requirements of final
rule paragraph (o), along with the general requirements in &#167; 1926.451,
appropriately address both types of scaffolds.</p>

<p>Paragraph (o)(1) provides, when two single-point adjustable suspension
scaffolds are combined to form a two-point adjustable suspension scaffold,
that the resulting scaffold meet the requirements for two-point adjustable
suspension scaffolds in final rule paragraph (p). This provision, which is
identical to the proposed paragraph, is based on existing &#167; 1926.451(k)(6).</p>

<p>Paragraph (o)(2) addresses the circumstances under which the supporting rope
between a scaffold and a suspension device is permitted to deviate from a
vertical position (i.e., at a 90 degree angle from level grade). This
paragraph requires that the supporting rope between the scaffold and the
suspension device be kept vertical unless the following four conditions are
met: the rigging must have been designed by a qualified person; the scaffold
must be accessible to rescuers; the supporting rope must be protected to
ensure that it will not chafe at any point where a change in direction
occurs; and the scaffold must not be able to sway into another surface.
Whenever swaying of the scaffold could bring the scaffold into contact with
another surface, the supporting rope must be vertical, with no exceptions.</p>

<p>Proposed paragraph &#167; 1926.452(o)(2) required that supporting ropes be vertical
and be kept from swaying, except where the scaffold is on the outside of a
dome-like or slanted structure and the appropriate supports have been
designed and installed. NPRM Issue 10 noted that existing &#167; 1926.451(k)(7)
requires the support rope for single-point adjustable suspension scaffolds to
be vertical. OSHA asked if the exception provided by proposed paragraph
(o)(2) was appropriate. The Agency further requested suggestions regarding a
maximum permissible angle and any other conditions that needed to be
specified.</p>

<p>The AGC (Exs. 2-20, 2-55, and 2-390) stated that "[a]ngles that are too
severe would impair work operation and thus preclude the use of suspensions."
Another commenter (Ex. 2-69) echoed that view, and added that "[f]lexibility
is needed for certain operations when using suspended scaffolds." A
manufacturer (Ex. 2-43) mentioned skylight and barrel-vault work as examples
of situations which preclude the use of vertical lines. The commenter also
stated "* * * when suspended, the worker must be accessible to rescuers. One
can envision a worker dangling in space below a dome with no way to get to
him."</p>

<p>Another commenter (Ex. 2-64) stated "[t]he supporting rope for single-point
adjustable suspension scaffolds <b class="ITALICS">should</b> be allowed to deviate from vertical
without defining any maximum limits. Each situation under these conditions is
a special case and has its own limiting circumstances. It would not be
feasible to establish standard limits for all possible special situations."
(emphasis in original) Another commenter (Ex. 2-22) stated that deviation
from vertical should be permitted. The commenter further stated "[t]he same
practical field problems arise in the case of a curved surface of any type as
does in the case of the dome-type or slanted structure. There is no safety
difference in the three special situations and they require an exception
because of their unique character."</p>

<p>One commenter (Ex. 2-13) stated as follows:</p>

<p>There never was a reason for the suspension rope for a single point
suspension scaffold to be vertical. In fact, most are used with the rope
other than vertical. The same applies for two point suspension scaffolds.
There is no maximum or minimum angle of deviation from the vertical. The load
reaction to the rope does not change; but the rope(s) must be protected from
sharp edges at the change in direction.</p>

<p>In addition, the SSFI and the SIA (Exs. 2-367 and 2-368) addressed this
issue in their comments on proposed &#167; 1926.452(o)(2). They recommended that,
when a scaffold is on the outside of a dome-type, slanted or set-in
structure, the use of intermediate supports to change the direction of the
rope from the vertical be allowed provided that such supports have been
designed by a competent person and have been installed in a manner that
prevents chafing of the rope.</p>

<p>The SIA (Ex. 2-368) commented that "[m]any work operations require
non-vertical lines due to set-backs, curved surfaces, areas under soffits,
following a bowser line, spherical water tanks, etc." In addition, the SSFI
responded to Issue 10 as follows "[t]he SSFI agrees that some deviation from
vertical support should be allowed. Cases in which this would occur are
special in nature and should only be allowed when designed by a competent
person."</p>

<p>The ACCSH (Tr. 96-97, 6-9-87) recommended that deviation from vertical
should be allowed only under the supervision of a "qualified person." A
member of the ACCSH stated that the qualified person would be "a competent
design engineer that has experience in this discipline."</p>

<p>OSHA agrees that there are circumstances where the support lines of
single-point adjustable suspension scaffolds need to deviate from vertical,
and that under controlled circumstances, the swaying of support lines should
be allowed. The Agency concludes that the requirements for design by a
qualified person, accessibility to rescuers, protection of supporting rope
from chafing, and prohibition of swaying where the scaffold could contact
another surface are appropriate measures, and final rule paragraph (o)(2)
reflects this determination.</p>

<p>Paragraph (o)(3) requires that the tackle used with boatswains' chairs be
ball bearing or bushed blocks containing safety hooks and properly "eye"
spliced minimum five-eight (5/8) inch (1.6 cm) diameter first grade manila
rope, or other rope that meets the performance criteria of the
above-specified manila rope. The proposed provision, based on existing
&#167; 1926.451(l)(5), was effectively identical, except that it did not
specifically address the hook used to suspend the boatswains' chair. OSHA
recognizes that the use of an open hook could allow a chair to be dislodged
if the rigging hung up on an obstruction. The corresponding ANSI standard,
A10.8-1988, paragraph 6.14.5, provides for the use of a hook with a safety
latch over the opening (safety hook) to prevent dislodging of the chair. The
Agency agrees that it is appropriate to explicitly require that employers who
have their employees use boatswains' chair rig their scaffolds with safety
hooks and has revised the proposed rule accordingly. In addition, OSHA
believes that locking safety hooks, such as are required for use with crane
and derrick suspended personnel platforms (&#167; 1926.550(g)(4)(iv)(B)), would
provide the most effective protection for affected employees. A minor
editorial revision to the proposed paragraph replaces the phrase "or
equivalent" with language which states clearly that any rope used in lieu of
5/8 inch diameter first grade manila rope must, at least, satisfy the final
rule's criteria (e.g., strength and durability) for manila rope.</p>

<p>Paragraph (o)(4) provides that boatswains' chair seat slings be reeved
through four corner holes in the seat; shall cross each other on the
underside of the seat; and shall be rigged so as to prevent slippage which
could cause an out-of-level condition. This paragraph, which is identical to
the proposed provision and is based on existing &#167; 1926.451(l)(2), is intended
to prevent tipping of the chair.</p>

<p>Paragraph (o)(5) requires, except as provided in paragraph (o)(6), that
boatswains' chair seat slings be a minimum of five-eight (5/8) inch (1.6 cm)
diameter fiber or synthetic rope or other rope which satisfies equivalent
performance criteria. This provision, which is substantively identical to the
proposed provision, is based on existing &#167; 1926.451(l)(2). A minor editorial
revision to the proposed paragraph replaces the phrase "or equivalent" with
language which states clearly that any rope used in lieu of 5/8 inch diameter
fiber or synthetic rope must, at least, satisfy the final rule's criteria
(e.g., strength, slip resistance, and durability) for fiber or synthetic
rope. In addition, the final rule has deleted the proposed language "when
employees are not using a heat-producing process such as gas or arc welding"
as being unnecessary since final rule paragraph (o)(6) specifically addresses
the issue of rope use when heat producing processes are in operation.</p>

<p>Paragraph (o)(6) requires that boatswains' chair seat slings be a minimum of
three-eight (3/8) inch (1.0 cm) wire rope, when a heat-producing process such
as gas or arc welding is being conducted. This provision, which is
substantively identical to the proposed provision and is based on existing
&#167; 1926.451(l)(3), is necessary to ensure that the chair's sling is made of
fire-resistant materials.</p>

<p>Paragraph (o)(7) requires that non-cross-laminated wood boatswains's chairs
be reinforced on their underside by cleats securely fastened to prevent the
board from splitting. This provision is identical to the proposed provision.
Existing &#167; 1926.451(l)(1) requires all boatswains' chairs to be cleated. As
noted in the preamble to the proposed rule (51 FR 42694), this paragraph
recognizes that plywood-type wood seats which comply with &#167; 1926.451(a)(1) are
strong enough to use as boatswains' chairs without being reinforced with
cleats.</p>

<p>Paragraph (p) Two-point Adjustable Suspension Scaffolds (Swing Stages)</p>

<p>Paragraph (p) provides additional requirements for two-point adjustable
suspension scaffolds (swing stages). The introduction to this paragraph
states that paragraph (q) addresses stonesetters' multi-point adjustable
suspension scaffolds, masons' multi-point adjustable suspension scaffolds or
other multi-point suspension scaffolds.</p>

<p>Paragraph (p)(1) provides that platforms not be more than 36 inches (0.9 m)
wide unless designed by a qualified person to prevent unstable conditions.
This provision, which is identical to proposed paragraph (p)(1), is
essentially the same as existing &#167; 1926.451(i)(1), which limits platform width
to 36 inches.</p>

<p>A commenter (Ex. 2-23) recommended that such platforms "* * * not be less
than 20 inches nor more than 36 (0.9 m) inches wide unless designed by a
registered civil or mechanical engineer to prevent unstable conditions." OSHA
has not adopted the commenter's recommendation for a 20-inch minimum width,
because the Agency considers the 18-inch minimum platform width set in final
rule &#167; 1926.451(b)(2) to be adequate. In addition, OSHA has not adopted a
requirement for a platform wider than 36 inches to be designed by a
registered engineer, because the Agency believes that a person who is
"qualified" as defined in both &#167;&#167; 1926.450(b) and 1926.32(m) will have the
skills and expertise needed to design such a platform.</p>

<p>Paragraph (p)(2) requires that the platform be securely fastened to hangers
(stirrups) by U-bolts or other means which satisfy &#167; 1926.451(a). This
provision is based on existing &#167; 1926.451(i)(1). Proposed paragraph (p)(2) has
been editorially revised to replace the term "equivalent means" with language
which indicates clearly that "other" means of fastening the platform to
hangers must satisfy the criteria of &#167; 1926.451(a).</p>

<p>Paragraph (p)(3) provides that the blocks for fiber or synthetic ropes
consist of at least one double and one single block, and that the sheaves of
all blocks fit the size of the rope used. This provision, which is identical
to the proposed provision and is based on existing &#167; 1926.451(i)(6), is
intended to ensure that these types of rope are maintained under proper
tension and do not slip out of their sheaves.</p>

<p>Paragraph (p)(4) requires that platforms be of the ladder-type, plank-type,
beam-type, or light-metal type. Light metal-type platforms having a rated
capacity of 750 pounds or less and platforms 40 feet (12.2 m) or less in
length shall be tested and listed by a nationally-recognized testing
laboratory. This provision is based on existing &#167; 1926.451(i)(10). Proposed
paragraph (p)(4) was similar to this provision of the final rule, except that
the final rule excludes platforms rated over 750 pounds or platforms longer
than 40 feet. This revision has been made based on a comment (Ex. 2-539)
which stated:</p>

<p>Underwriters' Laboratories has issued a standard for safety called UL 1322
covering fabricated scaffold stages. This standard covers stage platforms
with loads up to 750 pounds and lengths up to 40 feet. They do not have
standards covering heavier loads or longer lengths. It is not practical to
have a requirement for UL testing and approval on products that UL
arbitrarily refuses to test or approve.</p>

<p>The Agency notes that the 1994 edition of UL 1322 has the same limits cited
by the commenter, and agrees with the commenter that it is not realistic to
require testing and approval of a product that nationally-recognized testing
laboratories do not test or approve.</p>

<p>Proposed paragraph (p)(5) provided that two-point suspension scaffolds be
securely lashed to the building or structure to prevent them from swaying.
The paragraph further required that window cleaners' anchors not be used for
this purpose. The requirement now appears in final rule &#167; 1926.451(d)(18) and
is applicable to all multi-point suspended scaffolds. The provision is based
on existing &#167; 1926.451(i)(9).</p>

<p>Final paragraph (p)(5), proposed as paragraph (p)(6), requires that
two-point scaffolds not be bridged or otherwise connected one to another
during raising and lowering operations unless the bridge connections are
articulated and the hoists properly sized. This paragraph is similar to the
proposed paragraph, except for editorial revisions made for clarity. No
comments were received on this provision.</p>

<p>OSHA notes that paragraph (p)(5) is not intended to prohibit passage from
one scaffold to another, but to prevent significant overloading of the hoist
nearest the bridging device during operation of the hoist, or displacement of
the bridge if the hoist is used to raise or lower one of the scaffolds. Many
hoists are only sized to support one end of a two-point system. If one of two
bridged scaffolds were to be raised by a hoist, a bridge laid between the
scaffolds could be displaced unless the bridge is articulated (connected).
This could also significantly increase the load on the hoist if it is not
properly sized. The final rule addresses these two hazards by requiring
bridge connections to be articulated and requiring that hoists be properly
sized. These requirements thus allow for properly engineered solutions.</p>

<p>Final rule paragraph (p)(6), identical to proposed paragraph (p)(7), is a
new requirement. It allows passage from one platform to another only when the
platforms are at the same height, when the platforms abut each other, and
when walk-through stirrups specifically designed for this purpose are used.</p>

<p>Paragraph (q) Multi-point Suspension Scaffolds, Stonesetters' Multi-point
Adjustable Suspension Scaffolds, and Masons' Multi-point Adjustable
Suspension Scaffolds</p>

<p>Paragraph 1926.452(q) of the final rule provides additional requirements for
multi-point suspension scaffolds, stonesetters' multi-point adjustable
suspension scaffolds, and masons' multi-point adjustable suspension
scaffolds. This paragraph combines and clarifies the provisions of existing
&#167; 1926.451(h), stonesetters' adjustable multi-point suspension scaffolds, and
existing &#167; 1926.451(j), masons' adjustable multi-point suspension scaffolds,
and indicates clearly that paragraph (q) applies to other multi-point
adjustable suspension scaffolds as well.</p>

<p>Paragraph (q)(1) provides that, when two or more scaffolds are used, they
shall not be bridged one to another unless they are designed to be bridged,
the bridge connections are articulated (connected), and the hoists are
properly sized. This paragraph of the final rule, which is identical to
proposed paragraph (q)(1), is based on the same concerns about displacement
of the bridge and hoist overloading that resulted in final rule
&#167; 1926.452(p)(5).</p>

<p>Paragraph (q)(2) provides that, if bridges are not used, passage may be made
from one platform to another only when the platforms are at the same height
and are abutting. This provision, which is essentially identical to that in
the proposed rule, is based on the same concerns that resulted in final rule
&#167; 1926.452(p)(6). OSHA has editorially revised proposed paragraph (q)(2) to
delete the word "closely" because that word is redundant with the word
"abutting."</p>

<p>Paragraph (q)(3) requires that scaffolds be suspended from metal outriggers,
brackets, wire rope slings, hooks, or equivalent means. This provision, which
is essentially identical to the corresponding requirement in the proposed
rule, is virtually the same as existing &#167; 1926.451(j)(4), which addresses
stonesetters' adjustable multi-point suspension scaffolds. OSHA has deleted
the word "iron" from the proposed language, based on comments from the SSFI
and the SIA (Exs. 2-367 and 2-368) stating that it is appropriate to have
brackets or hooks fabricated from material other than iron. OSHA agrees with
this point and concludes that employees on these scaffolds will be adequately
protected by brackets or hooks made of other materials, as long as those
components satisfy the strength criteria set in final rule &#167; 1926.451(a)(1).
The final rule reflects this conclusion.</p>

<p>Paragraph (r) Catenary Scaffolds</p>

<p>Paragraph 1926.452(r) of the final rule provides additional requirements for
catenary scaffolds. In OSHA's existing scaffold standard, catenary scaffolds
were addressed only by the general provisions applicable to all scaffolds.
The new provisions in paragraph (r) thus address specific concerns not
directly addressed by the existing standard. These provisions are identical
to proposed &#167; 1926.452(r).</p>

<p>Paragraph (r)(1) allows no more than one platform to be placed between
consecutive vertical pickups, and no more than two platforms to be used on a
catenary scaffold. These requirements are intended to prevent overloading of
this type of scaffold. This paragraph is consistent with the corresponding
provision of ANSI A10.8-1988, paragraph 20.4.</p>

<p>Paragraph (r)(2) requires that platforms supported by wire ropes have
hook-shaped stops on each end of the platforms to prevent the platforms from
slipping off the wire ropes. These hooks shall be so placed that they will
prevent the platforms from falling if one of the horizontal wire ropes
breaks. This language is consistent with the corresponding provision of ANSI
A10.8-1988, paragraph 20.1.</p>

<p>Paragraph (r)(3) of the final rule provides that wire ropes shall not be
tightened to the extent that the application of a scaffold load will
overstress them. This provision is consistent with the corresponding language
of ANSI A10.8-1988, paragraph 20.2.</p>

<p>Paragraph (r)(4) requires that wire ropes be continuous and without splices
between anchors. This language is consistent with the corresponding language
in ANSI A10.8-1988, paragraph 20.2, and is necessary to ensure that the rope
has sufficient integrity to handle the load.</p>

<p>Paragraph (s) Float (Ship) Scaffolds</p>

<p>Paragraph (s) provides additional requirements for float (ship) scaffolds.
These provisions are identical to those in proposed &#167; 1926.452(s), which were
based on existing &#167;&#167; 1926.451(w)(3) and (5).</p>

<p>Paragraph (s)(1) requires that the platform be supported by a minimum of two
bearers, each of which shall project a minimum of six inches (15.2 cm) beyond
the platform on both sides. This will ensure that the platform will be fully
supported. In addition, each bearer shall be securely fastened to the
platform to prevent slippage.</p>

<p>Paragraph (s)(2) provides that rope connections shall be such that the
platform cannot shift or slip. Platform slippage is a significant factor in
scaffold accidents.</p>

<p>Paragraph (s)(3) provides that, when only two ropes are used with each
float, those ropes shall be arranged so as to provide four ends which are
securely fastened to overhead supports, and each supporting rope shall be
hitched around one end of the bearer and pass under the platform to the other
end of the bearer where it is hitched again, leaving sufficient rope at each
end for the supporting ties. This requirement is necessary to ensure that the
supporting ropes are properly attached to both the platform and to the
overhead support to prevent the scaffold from falling. These requirements are
designed to ensure safe use of these commonly used job-built scaffolds.</p>

<p>Paragraph (t) Interior Hung Scaffolds</p>

<p>Paragraph (t) provides additional requirements for interior hung scaffolds.
These provisions are identical to those of the proposed paragraph. Paragraph
(t)(1) requires that scaffolds be suspended only from the roof structure or
other structural members such as ceiling beams. This requirement is necessary
to ensure that these suspended scaffolds are supported by structural members
with adequate capacity for safe use. This is the same requirement as existing
&#167; 1926.451(r)(1).</p>

<p>Paragraph (t)(2), which is a new provision, requires that the supporting
members be inspected and checked for strength before the scaffold is erected.
This requirement is necessary because such points of support cannot be
assumed to be strong enough to support a scaffold since they may already be
loaded to their capacity or they may have deteriorated over time. This
provision is consistent with ANSI A10.8-1988, paragraph 16.7.</p>

<p>Paragraph (t)(3) provides that suspension ropes and cables be connected to
the overhead supporting members by shackles, clips, thimbles, or by other
means which provide equivalent strength, security and durability. This
paragraph of the final rule (identical to the proposed paragraph) deletes the
specific connection requirements of existing &#167; 1926.451(r)(2), which OSHA
determined were obsolete, and specifies criteria that OSHA has found to be
current safe practice. The strength requirement of existing &#167; 1926.451(r)(2) is
now covered by final rule paragraph &#167; 1926.451(a)(3), which specifies strength
criteria for suspension ropes on all types of scaffolds.</p>

<p>Paragraph (u) Needle Beam Scaffolds</p>

<p>Paragraph (u) of the final rule provides additional requirements for needle
beam scaffolds. These provisions are identical to proposed paragraph
&#167; 1926.452(u) except for minor editorial revisions. Paragraph (u)(1) requires
that scaffold support beams be installed on edge. This provision is based on
existing &#167; 1926.451(p)(1), and is necessary to ensure that support beams are
installed in a way that maximizes their strength.</p>

<p>Paragraph (u)(2) provides that ropes or hangers be used for supports, except
that one end of a needle beam scaffold may be supported by a permanent
structural member. This provision is based on existing &#167; 1926.451(p)(2) and
(8), and is necessary to ensure that these scaffolds are properly supported
by rope or hangers that meet the strength criteria of &#167; 1926.451(a).</p>

<p>Paragraph (u)(3) requires that the ropes be securely attached to the needle
beams. This is a change from existing &#167; 1926.451(p)(3), which specified that
all rope attachments must be either a scaffold hitch or properly made eye
splices. OSHA determined that the existing rule is too restrictive, because
other knots and means of attachment, such as wire rope clips, can adequately
support the scaffold without decreasing employee safety.</p>

<p>Paragraph (u)(4) provides that the support connection be arranged so as to
prevent the needle beam from rolling or becoming displaced, which could
result in tipping of the platform. This provision is based on existing
&#167; 1926.451(p)(4).</p>

<p>Paragraph (u)(5) provides that platform units shall be securely attached to
the needle beams by bolts or equivalent means. In addition, cleats and
overhang are not considered to be adequate means of attachment. Final rule
paragraph (u)(5) clarifies the requirements of existing &#167; 1926.451(p)(6), which
only required that planks be secured against slipping. Also, under the
existing rule, cleats and overhang could be used to secure the units. As
stated in the preamble to the NPRM (51 FR 42695), OSHA has concluded that
cleats or overhang do not adequately secure platform units to needle beam
scaffolds, because needle beam scaffolds have a tendency to twist, and cleats
and overhangs used to secure platforms will not provide sufficient means of
holding the platforms. This could result in platforms coming loose and
falling.</p>

<p>Paragraph (v) Multi-level Suspended Scaffolds</p>

<p>Paragraph &#167; 1926.452(v) of the final rule provides additional requirements for
multi-level suspended scaffolds. These scaffolds are suspended scaffolds with
more than one working level. The provisions of paragraph (v) are identical to
those in the proposed paragraph, except for minor editorial changes. Although
these types of scaffolds are not specifically addressed in the existing
standard, they are covered by the general requirements in existing &#167; 1926.451.
The new provisions address concerns not covered by the existing standard or
by final rule &#167; 1926.451.</p>

<p>Paragraph (v)(1) requires that multi-level suspended platform scaffolds be
equipped with additional independent support lines, equal in number to the
number of points supported and of equivalent strength to the suspension
ropes, and be rigged to support the scaffold in the event the suspension
rope(s) fail. These additional lines would support the scaffold, and prevent
collapse in the event of primary support line failure.</p>

<p>Paragraph (v)(2) provides that the independent support lines and suspension
ropes shall not be attached to the same points of anchorage. This provision
reflects OSHA concern that the independent support lines would not protect
workers from scaffold collapse if the independent lines and the suspension
ropes were attached to the same anchorage point when the anchorage failed.</p>

<p>Paragraph (v)(3) requires that supports for platforms be attached directly
to the support stirrup and not to any other platform. This provision is
intended to protect against platform overloading.</p>

<p>Paragraph (w) Mobile Scaffolds</p>

<p>Paragraph (w) provides additional rules for mobile scaffolds. This paragraph
consolidates and clarifies the provisions of existing &#167; 1926.451(e) and
existing &#167; 1926.453. This paragraph applies to all mobile scaffolds, not just
to those which are manually propelled. This paragraph of the final rule is
effectively identical to that in the proposed rule, except as discussed
below.</p>

<p>Paragraph (w)(1) provides that scaffolds shall be braced by cross,
horizontal, or diagonal braces, or combination thereof, to prevent racking or
collapse of the scaffold and to secure vertical members together laterally so
as to automatically square and align the vertical members. In addition,
scaffolds shall be plumb, level, and squared. All brace connections shall be
secured. This paragraph also provides that scaffolds constructed of tube and
coupler components shall conform to the requirements of &#167; 1926.452(b)
(paragraph (w)(1)(i)), and that scaffolds constructed of fabricated frame
components shall conform to the requirements of &#167; 1926.452(c) (paragraph
(w)(1)(ii)). The provisions of paragraph (w)(1) are substantively identical
to the corresponding provisions in existing &#167;&#167; 1926.451(e)(3) and (e)(9).</p>

<p>Paragraph (w)(2) requires that scaffold casters and wheels be locked with
positive wheel and/or wheel and swivel locks, or equivalent means, to prevent
movement of the scaffold while the scaffold is used in a stationary manner.
This provision is effectively identical to existing &#167; 1926.451(e)(8).</p>

<p>Paragraph (w)(3) provides that manual force used to move the scaffold shall
be applied as close to the base as practicable, but not more than five feet
(1.5 m) above the supporting surface. This paragraph is essentially the same
as existing &#167; 1926.451(e)(6), which required that propelling forces be applied
as close to the base as possible. However, the final rule limits the height
at which the force can be applied to 5 feet above the supporting surface, to
minimize overturning forces. One commenter (Ex. 2-23) recommended that
scaffolds not be moved manually unless the propelling force is applied to the
wheels only. Although such a requirement may be appropriate for powered
scaffolds, the Agency sees no rationale for applying this provision to
scaffolds being moved manually. OSHA has not adopted the suggested change
because compliance would be unwieldy and would expose employees to hazards
from the rolling wheels.</p>

<p>The proposed language has been modified in the final rule to indicate
clearly that final paragraph (w)(3) applies only when mobile scaffolds are
being moved manually. This provision is consistent with ANSI A10.8-1988,
paragraph 11.3.1.</p>

<p>Paragraph (w)(4), which is a new provision, requires that power systems used
to propel mobile scaffolds be designed for such use. In addition, forklifts,
trucks, similar motor vehicles, or add-on motors shall not be used to propel
scaffolds unless the scaffold is designed for such propulsion systems.</p>

<p>Paragraph (w)(5) requires that scaffolds be stabilized to prevent tipping
during movement. This provision is effectively identical to the corresponding
provision in existing &#167; 1926.451(e)(6).</p>

<p>Paragraph (w)(6) provides that employees shall not be allowed to ride on
scaffolds unless the following conditions exist:</p>

<p>1. The surface on which the scaffold is being moved shall be within three
degrees of level, and free of pits, holes, and obstructions (paragraph
(w)(6)(i));</p>

<p>2. The height-to-base width ratio of the scaffold during movement shall be
two to one or less, unless the scaffold is designed and constructed to meet
or exceed nationally-recognized stability test requirements (paragraph
(w)(6)(ii));</p>

<p>3. Outrigger frames, when used, shall be installed on both sides of the
scaffold (paragraph (w)(6)(iii));</p>

<p>4. When power systems are used, the propelling force shall be applied
directly to the wheels, and shall not produce a speed in excess of one foot
per second (0.3 mps) (paragraph (w)(6)(iv)); and</p>

<p>5. No employee is on any part of the scaffold which extends outward beyond
the wheels, casters, or other supports (paragraph (w)(6)(v)).</p>

<p>These provisions are based in part on the provisions of existing
&#167; 1926.451(e)(7).</p>

<p>Proposed paragraph (w)(6)(ii) set the maximum height-to-base width ratio at
two to one or less. OSHA has revised the proposed provision to allow a higher
ratio when the scaffold is designed and constructed in accordance with
nationally-recognized stability test requirements. This change is discussed
in relation to Issue 4, below.</p>

<p>Proposed paragraph (x)(6)(iv) required that the propelling force be applied
directly to the wheels (not to the frame) when power systems are used to
propel scaffolds, and limited the speed of the scaffold to 2 feet per second.
The proposed provision was intended to protect against a scaffold toppling
over should it strike an object.</p>

<p>One commenter (Ex. 2-423) stated as follows:</p>

<p>In our initial testing we tested several speeds including 2'/Sec and found
these to be far too fast for an operator to drive through narrow areas and
through debris that would be encountered on a construction site. With all the
units sold by our company, I have never had anyone say the Motorized Scaffold
(r) was too slow. I cannot speak for other means of propelling scaffold but
we would not allow our Motorized Scaffold (r) to drive faster than one foot
per second.</p>

<p>OSHA agrees that allowing motor-propelled scaffolds to drive faster than one
foot per second could create problems for operators and has revised the rule
accordingly.</p>

<p>Issue 4 raised a question regarding existing &#167; 1926.451(e)(7)(ii), which
required manually propelled mobile scaffolds to be not more than twice as
high as they are wide when employees ride on them. The proposed rule,
&#167; 1926.452(w), extended this requirement to cover both manually propelled and
motor-propelled mobile scaffolds. OSHA asked whether the final rule should
raise the current ratio, 2:1, to 3:1 or higher on those systems which are
built with a lower center of gravity, and, if so, what would be appropriate
limitations.</p>

<p>The ACCSH discussed Issue 4 at length (Tr. 48-61, June 9, 1987). Several
members expressed concern about employees riding mobile scaffolds while the
scaffolds were being moved, regardless of the height-to-base ratio mandated.
As OSHA explained to the Committee, scaffold equipment manufacturers had
informed the Agency that a motor propelled mobile scaffold which exceeded the
existing and proposed 2:1 ratio would be safe for use because the attachment
of motor units would lower the center of gravity, thereby increasing the
scaffold's stability (Tr. 52-53). Members of the Advisory Committee
questioned the extent to which the weight of the motor unit would provide
sufficient stability, citing concerns about the manner in which employers
would calculate the height-to-base ratio using the weight of the motor unit
and the extent to which wind or overhead power lines would pose hazards.
Ultimately, the ACCSH voted to recommend simply that OSHA prohibit riding on
mobile scaffolds (Tr. 61).</p>

<p>One commenter (Ex. 2-53) stated that the "existing rule on manually
propelled mobile scaffolds" should not be extended to motor-propelled mobile
scaffolds but did not explain why. The AGC commented (Exs. 2-20, 2-55, and
2-390) that "[i]n maintaining a performance-oriented standard, OSHA should
provide for manufacturer's recommendations when movement of a rolling
scaffold is required." These three comments further stated that OSHA should
allow the use of those mobile scaffolds that have a lower center of gravity
and thus have the capability "of being moved at a higher ratio." Another
participant (Ex. 2-69) commented that "[W]hen movement of a rolling scaffold
is required, OSHA should provide for use of manufacturers' recommendations in
keeping with a performance-oriented approach."</p>

<p>One commenter (Ex. 2-70) stated that 3:1 ratio would be acceptable if the
scaffold had a low center of gravity. Another commenter (Ex. 2-516) added a
number of details and factors involved in calculating or arriving at a safe
"gross ratio" for mobile scaffolds, and indicated that "higher ratios may be
permitted in specific instances when operated under constant and continuous
supervision, and when designed by qualified engineers." In particular, the
commenter explained that the 2:1 ratio "is a minimum standard, established
for <b class="ITALICS">uniformity, simplicity, and safety</b>. Higher ratios can easily be achieved
in given instances, but allowing those ratios to be in general use is unwise"
(emphasis in the original). To illustrate the rationale behind this
assertion, the commenter stated, in part, that:</p>

<p>There is a moment in each vertical rolling scaffold leg due to caster
offset. This moment is increased when the wheel is stopped by a stone or
curb, because the tower inertia then acts on the caster support as a force
acting from the center of gravity of the tower, to the wheel.</p>

<p>The force from the `pushing' and the inertia change depends on the weight of
the scaffold, its velocity, how fast it stops, and how hard it is being
pushed or driven. The moment felt at the scaffold leg depends on the force,
the height of the center of gravity, the flatness of the rolling surface,
whether only one wheel carries the load, and where on the scaffold it is
being pushed.</p>

<p>The height of the center of gravity depends on how much load is put on top
of the scaffold, and the height of the scaffold. [emphasis in original]</p>

<p>Another commenter (Ex. 2-50) stated that an extension of the ratio for some
scaffolds should not be limited to 3:1. As an example, the commenter
explained that "some motorized scaffolding, and batteries, hydraulics, and
motors mounted low on the frame are capable of reaching 20-30 feet high with
their bases only 6 feet wide." The commenter, a representative from a
building contractor's association, added that "the manufacturers test the
machines extensively for upset."</p>

<p>One commenter (Ex. 2-15) stated "[e]ven the 2:1 is too permissive for small,
light towers which are usually the most top[-]heavy, especially with a man on
top. This provision is not enforceable. [It would be] better to forbid riding
at all." Another commenter (Ex. 2-29) commented that "[i]ncreasing the
height-to-base ratio of mobile scaffolds ridden by employees would expose
employees to an unacceptable fall hazard." In addition, a commenter (Ex.
2-54) stated that "2 to 1 is a good ratio, as there is less chance of tipping
over and a better chance for worker[s] to jump off [the] scaffold, and not
get hurt, if [the] scaffold began to tip." The SSFI (Ex. 2-367) recommended
that "under no circumstances should the 2:1 height-to-width ratio be raised
to 3:1 for systems built with a `lower center of gravity.' Tipping of rolling
towers is one of the primary causes of accidents and no changes should be
made."</p>

<p>The SSFI further stated that they have "always and will continue to
recommend prohibiting riding rolling scaffolds." The commenter noted that
"riding of motor[-]propelled scaffolds is especially hazardous as the
scaffold is normally not designed for such loads. Motors should not be added
to scaffold towers unless the towers are specially designed to accommodate
those forces." Another commenter (Ex. 2-476), also holding the view that
riding rolling scaffolds should not be allowed, recommended that:</p>

<p>Motorized means should not be attached to frame scaffold towers to promote
riding. The 2 to 1 base-to-height ratio, which allows riding, is not being
used by workers riding rolling towers, and workers are riding rolling towers
with any base-to-height ratio. The scaffold frame rolling towers were not
designed to be ridden, and were not designed for special add-on motors for
propulsion.</p>

<p>Another commenter (Ex. 2-13) stated "[m]obile scaffolds should never be
moved when occupied. The only time they are involved in accidents is when
they are moved while occupied. To allow any but specifically designed
scaffolds to be moved while occupied is totally unacceptable."</p>

<p>The SIA (Ex. 2-368) indicated that:</p>

<p>[M]any of our members advocate prohibiting riding of mobile scaffolds at any
time. Others oppose such drastic action, since this would place undue
hardship on those trades which perform a high percentage of their work on
mobile scaffolds. The alternative is to develop provisions for their safe
use* * * Motors should not be added to scaffold towers unless the towers are
specifically designed to accommodate the increased forces exerted on the legs
of the scaffold frames.</p>

<p>The SIA (Ex. 2-368) also stated that statistics they had developed over the
past 10 years "indicate a high incidence of accidents on rolling scaffolds,"
and that "[i]t is our position that any raising of the 2:1 ratio would result
in increased accidents."</p>

<p>A commenter (Ex. 2-476) stated that scaffold frames are not designed for the
forces imposed on them by motors that are added on for propulsion. OSHA
agrees with the commenters who raised concerns about the ability of scaffold
frames to accommodate motors and has modified proposed &#167; 1926.452(x)(6)
accordingly.</p>

<p>OSHA agrees with the commenters who indicated that the riding of some mobile
scaffolds can be hazardous. However, OSHA believes that the rulemaking record
supports modification of the current regulations to allow greater use of
mobile scaffolds for this purpose, provided additional appropriate
precautions are taken.</p>

<p>The key concern in specifying the existing 2:1 ratio is stability of the
scaffold. OSHA believes, based on the evidence submitted, that the existing
2:1 ratio is still the appropriate limit for all manually-propelled mobile
scaffolds and has promulgated final rule paragraph (w)(6)(ii) accordingly.</p>

<p>OSHA also believes that, given appropriate engineering design, there are
higher ratios which can be used safely on some power-propelled mobile
scaffolds. As recommended by one commenter (Ex. 2-423), such designs must be
proven to be safe, however, by subjecting the scaffold to stability tests
such as the nationally recognized ANSI A92 tests used by the manufacturers of
elevating and rotating work platforms. Where such tests have not been made,
employees are not allowed to ride the scaffold. This, OSHA notes, does not
preclude manufacturers or others from conducting or establishing such tests
to demonstrate that a product meets appropriate stability criteria. The
Agency believes that equipment meeting such tests and criteria should be
permissible and has promulgated final rule paragraph (w)(6)(iii) accordingly.</p>

<p>OSHA also believes that compliance with the requirements of &#167; 1926.451 and
final rule paragraph (w)(6)(iv) (that the power be applied directly to the
wheels and that the speed be limited to no more than 1 foot per second, as
recommended by a commenter (Ex. 2-423)) adequately addresses cases where a
mobile scaffold is equipped with a motor.</p>

<p>Paragraph (w)(7), which is identical to the proposed paragraph, requires
that platforms not extend outward beyond the base supports of the scaffold
unless outrigger frames or equivalent devices are used to ensure stability.
Compliance with this provision will prevent eccentric loading of the scaffold
frame that could cause the scaffold to tip over.</p>

<p>Paragraph (w)(8) provides that, where leveling of the scaffold is necessary,
screw jacks or equivalent means be used. This is a specific way of complying
with &#167; 1926.451(c)(2) of the final rule, which requires firm, level
foundations. This provision is consistent with the corresponding provision in
ANSI A10.8-1988, paragraph 11.1.4.</p>

<p>Paragraph (w)(9) requires that caster stems and wheel stems be pinned or
otherwise secured to scaffold legs or adjustment screws. Proposed paragraph
(w)(9) was identical, except that it did not specifically provide for the
securing of stems to adjustment screws. This revision is based on input
received on this provision from the SSFI and SIA (Exs. 2-367 and 2-368). OSHA
agrees that adjustment screws provide appropriate attachment points for
caster stems and wheel stems, so that specifically mentioning them in the
final rule will clearly express the Agency's intent and facilitate
compliance.</p>

<p>Paragraph (w)(10) provides that, before a scaffold is moved, employees on
the scaffold shall be made aware of the move. This requirement, which was not
part of the proposal, is based on input received from a commenter (Ex. 2-23)
on this section. OSHA agrees with this input, and has revised the proposed
paragraph accordingly. In addition, OSHA notes that this requirement is
consistent with ANSI A10.8-1988, paragraph 11.2.3.5.</p>

<p>Issue 14 asked whether OSHA should allow mobile scaffolds to move only along
their longitudinal axes while employees are riding on them. OSHA noted that
compliance with this provision, which was suggested by ACCSH (Ex. 4), would
maximize scaffold stability during movement, because tipping is more likely
to occur when a scaffold is moved along its transverse axis.</p>

<p>Two commenters (Exs. 2-50 and 2-368) stated that such a provision would be
difficult to enforce. Three commenters (Exs. 2-22, 2-53, and 2-368) also
stated that this provision would be impractical. The SIA (Ex. 2-368) went on
to explain that:</p>

<p>[S]uch a provision would make it difficult for workers to perform their
duties without violating standards. Sometimes it is necessary to make even
slight adjusting movement of the scaffold in order to reach the area of work.
If workers were prohibited from moving the scaffold even the slightest amount
along the narrow axis, they would tend to extend their reach over the side of
the scaffold, thus creating an even greater hazard.</p>

<p>Some mobile scaffolds are almost square, which would require a tape measure
to determine when there would be a violation. The fatigue created by the
worker climbing up and down each time he wished to move the scaffold would
tend to increase the likelihood of an accident.</p>

<p>Another commenter (Ex. 2-50) reasoned that it had never had a scaffold
accident under the existing standards, so it expected that the proposed
requirement would be unreasonably restrictive and difficult to monitor.
Another commenter (Ex. 2-22) foresaw no increase in employee safety to
balance against possible problems encountered by those required to implement
the provisions.</p>

<p>On the other hand, one commenter (Ex. 2-29) simply favored adopting the
suggested provision. Another commenter (Ex. 2-43) agreed that "rolling
scaffolds should be moved in a safe manner" but added that "[e]nforcing this
requirement will continue to provide special challenges."</p>

<p>Five commenters (Exs. 2-13, 2-15, 2-37, 2-54, and 2-367) found the provision
unacceptable, because they felt employees should not be permitted to ride
mobile scaffolds at all. Another commenter (Ex. 2-308), responding to
proposed &#167; 1926.452(w), also said that employees should never be allowed to
ride scaffolds. One other commenter (Ex. 2-13) agreed but added an exception
for scaffolds "that have been specifically designed for such movement."</p>

<p>OSHA agrees with the SIA (Ex. 2-368), which indicated that such a
requirement would make it difficult for workers to perform their duties
without violating the standard because it would sometimes be necessary to
make slight adjustments of a scaffold to safely reach the work area. OSHA is
concerned that if workers were prohibited from moving the scaffold along its
transverse axis, even slightly, they would find themselves in circumstances
where they would extend their bodies over the side of the scaffold to reach a
place where they need to perform work, instead of climbing down the scaffold
to reposition it. This would create a greater hazard because the employee
would be at risk of falling or of tipping the scaffold.</p>

<p>Accordingly, the Agency has not adopted the suggested language in the final
rule. OSHA believes the proposed provisions set forth in &#167; 1926.452(w), Mobile
Scaffolds, appropriately address the concerns of employees riding scaffolds.</p>

<p>(x) Repair Bracket Scaffolds</p>

<p>The March 29, 1993, Federal Register notice reopening the rulemaking record
(58 FR 16509) sought information regarding "chimney bracket scaffolds." The
Agency described such scaffolds as consisting of platforms supported by
brackets which are secured in place by one or more wire ropes placed in an
approximately horizontal plane around the circumference of the structure and
tensioned by a turnbuckle. The Agency noted that it had recently received
information (Exs. 31 and 32) which suggested that proposed &#167; 1926.451 might not
adequately protect employees on these scaffolds from falls and other hazards.</p>

<p>OSHA noted that it was considering whether specific fall protection
requirements were needed in subpart L for protection of employees on chimney
bracket scaffolds. The Agency also noted that it was considering the
appropriateness of promulgating technical requirements for chimney bracket
scaffolds that are more detailed than those proposed for scaffolds in
general. Accordingly, the March 29, 1993, Federal Register notice presented a
series of questions aimed at developing criteria for safe use of chimney
bracket scaffolds. One commenter (Ex. 34-35) stated "[u]nless it can be
determined by a competent person beforehand that the chimney can support a
bracket and an independent safety line and fall protection is used, other
means such as balling, explosives or remote crane suspended hydraulic
attachments should be used." OSHA also received substantive input on chimney
bracket scaffolds [repair bracket scaffolds] from one commenter, the National
Advisory Committee for Health &#38; Safety in the Chimney, Stack, Silo and
Natural Draft Cooling Tower Industry (NACHS) (Ex. 34-33). Those comments are
discussed below in relation to the pertinent provisions of the final rule.
The NACHS, a trade association presenting the experience and views of
companies which use the scaffolds in question, referred to these scaffolds as
"repair bracket work platforms" in its comment. Based on that input, the
Agency has determined that the term "repair bracket scaffold" should be used
in place of the term "chimney bracket scaffold."</p>

<p>The NACHS (Ex. 34-33) indicated that a "repair bracket scaffold" is a type
of supported scaffold that has been used safely for over 80 years for
tuckpointing on brick chimneys; crack repairs; the installation of bands on
brick or concrete chimneys; painting; access to caps, hoods, and lightning
protection systems; installation of permanent platforms; piece-meal
demolition of brick, concrete, and steel chimneys; waterproofing brick and
concrete chimneys; 360 degree access at any given elevation for any activity;
and steeple access. According to the commenter, these scaffolds are installed
by encircling a structure with a minimum one-half-inch diameter wire,
tensioned by a minimum one-inch turnbuckle. Brackets are then placed over the
wire rope, and scaffold planking (12-inch minimum width), guardrail posts and
handrails are installed on the brackets.</p>

<p>Based on the information received, OSHA again reopened the rulemaking record
(59 FR 4615, February 1, 1994) to solicit comment on draft regulatory text
that the Agency was considering for inclusion in the final rule. In addition,
the Agency noted that it was considering whether employees working on chimney
bracket scaffolds needed to be protected from fall hazards by both a "Type I"
guardrail, as would have been required by proposed &#167; 1926.451(e)(4), and a
personal fall arrest system. Also, OSHA noted that it was considering what
provisions must be made for rescue of employees from chimney bracket
scaffolds in the event of scaffold collapse or a medical emergency. The
Agency indicated that it was developing criteria for employers who would need
to comply with these provisions. As is discussed below in relation to the
provisions of final rule paragraph (x), the Agency also raised Items (a)
through (l) for consideration as prospective provisions of the final rule.
(All references to Items and Issues in this paragraph of the preamble relate
to the February 1, 1994 reopening notice.) The one commenter, Monsanto, (Ex.
43-45) who responded to those Items stated that they should be adopted in the
final rule.</p>

<p>Based on the rulemaking record, OSHA has determined that it is appropriate
to add a new paragraph (x) to &#167; 1926.452 to address the use of `repair bracket
scaffolds'. In addition, a definition of that term, based on the NACHS
comment, is being added to &#167; 1926.450(b), Definitions.</p>

<p>Paragraph (x)(1) requires employers to secure brackets in place with 1/2
inch diameter wire rope that extends around the circumference of the chimney.
This provision, which incorporates the language from Items (a) and (b) of the
February 1, 1994 notice (59 FR 4617), codifies established good industry
practice as described by the NACHS (Ex. 34-33).</p>

<p>Final rule paragraph (x)(2) requires that each bracket be attached to the
securing wire rope (or ropes) by a positive locking device capable of
preventing the unintentional detachment of the bracket from the rope, or by
some other means which prevents unintentional detachment. The NACHS (Ex.
34-33) indicated that brackets are positioned on the cable in the course of
erecting the scaffold. Issue 6 asked if OSHA should require a positive
locking device on the bracket hook that is placed over the wire rope to
prevent unintentional separation of the bracket from the wire rope.
Continental Chimney Inc. (CCI) and NACHS (Exs. 43-1 and 43-21) supported such
a requirement.</p>

<p>Final rule paragraph (x)(3) requires that each bracket, at the contact point
between the supporting structure and the bottom of the bracket, be provided
with a "shoe" (heel block or foot) capable of preventing the lateral movement
of the bracket. Issue 7 asked if OSHA should incorporate such a requirement
in the final rule. CCI and NACHS (Exs. 43-1 and 43-21) commented that a
"shoe" was needed to prevent lateral movement. In addition, CCI stated "The
bottom of our [bracket] feet have an angle cut into them to prevent them from
getting caught up on obstructions on the chimney and becoming disconnected if
the scaffold system should slip."</p>

<p>Final rule paragraph (x)(4) requires that platform units be secured to
brackets in a manner that prevents the separation of platform units from
brackets and prevents movement of platform units or brackets on a completed
scaffold. This provision is based on Item (e), which provided that platform
units shall be secured to the brackets. Issue 4 asked how employers should
fasten platform units to brackets so that they do not inadvertently detach.
CCI (Ex. 43-1) stated "We have used 1/8" cable with 1/4" rope. 1/4" rope is
enough most of the time. The 1/8" cable provides added security and can be
secured adequately be tying it in right along side the 1/4" rope. Using
clamps here would never work." The NACHS (Ex. 43-21) responded that employers
should secure platform units to brackets "[b]y any positive system available,
i.e., wire, rope, etc." OSHA has determined that it is appropriate to allow
employers flexibility in choosing the means of securing platform units and
has added final rule paragraph (x)(4) accordingly.</p>

<p>Final rule paragraph (x)(5) provides that, when a wire rope is placed around
a structure to provide safe anchorage for personal fall arrest systems that
are used by employees erecting or dismantling repair bracket scaffolds, the
wire rope shall be at least 5/16 inches in diameter and shall, in all other
respects, satisfy the requirements of subpart M, OSHA's Fall Protection
Standard. This paragraph, which is effectively identical to Item (l) of the
February Notice, codifies established good practices as described by the
NACHS (Ex. 34-33).</p>

<p>Final rule paragraph (x)(6) requires that each wire rope used for securing
brackets in place or as an anchorage for personal fall arrest systems be
protected from damage due to contact with edges, corners, protrusions, or
other discontinuities of the supporting structure or scaffold components.
Issue 10 of the Reopening Notice asked how employers protected wire ropes
from abrasion. CCI (Ex. 43-1) stated "Our brackets hold the cable 3" below
our decking." The NACHS (Ex. 43-21) responded "[t]he bracket scaffold support
cable is static, and abrasion experienced from * * * installation does not
affect its integrity. The hardwood cable block spacers (@ [+ or -] 36"
centers) minimize and often prevent the cable from making contact with the
structure's surface." OSHA has determined, based on the comments, that
adequate means of protecting wire rope from abrasion are readily available to
affected employers.</p>

<p>Final rule paragraph (x)(7) provides that tensioning of each wire rope used
for securing brackets in place or as an anchorage for personal fall arrest
systems shall be by means of a turnbuckle at least 1 inch in diameter, or by
some other equivalent means. This paragraph, which is very similar to Item
(b) of the Reopening Notice, codifies established good practice as described
by the NACHS (Ex. 34-33). OSHA has allowed employers the flexibility to use
means other than a single turnbuckle for tensioning wire ropes, where the
alternative means provide equivalent tension, because the Agency wants to
encourage innovation and provide flexibility. In addition, OSHA anticipates,
based on information from NACHS (Ex. 34-33), that there may be circumstances
where more than one turnbuckle will be needed to tension the wire rope,
depending on the diameter of the chimney.</p>

<p>Final rule paragraph (x)(8) requires that each turnbuckle be connected to
the other end of its rope by use of a proper-size eyesplice thimble. Issue 8
of the February Notice asked if OSHA should add such a requirement to the
final rule. CCI (Ex. 43-1) stated "Thimbles are very helpful in keeping the
cable in good condition. These can be fit over the turn buckle eye and then
closed back up." Also, the NACHS (Ex. 43-21) commented that OSHA should add a
requirement for the use of a proper size thimble.</p>

<p>Final rule paragraph (x)(9) provides that U-bolt wire rope clips shall not
be used on any wire rope used to secure brackets or to serve as an anchor for
personal fall arrest systems. OSHA expressed concern in the February 1, 1994
reopening notice that the use of U-bolt wire rope clips as wire rope
fasteners on the horizontal support ropes could result in damage to the dead
end of the rope. Further, if a segment of damaged dead end later were to
become part of the live end due to an increase in the circumference of the
structure, the Agency was concerned that the wire rope would be unable to
support the loads imposed on it.</p>

<p>CCI responded (Ex. 43-1) "The use of U wire rope clips does not damage the
wire rope significantly when they are not over-tightened. Double-saddle clips
are not as strong as U wire rope clips and are difficult to put on the
cable." Also, Charles Greene (Ex. 43-47), a safety consultant, stated he
"[w]ould recommend that fist or saddle clips be used to fasten the horizontal
support ropes that support the bracket scaffolds."</p>

<p>OSHA disagrees with CCI regarding the safety of using U-bolt wire rope
clips, based on the Agency's review of <b class="ITALICS">Rosnagles Handbook of Rigging and the
Wire Rope User's Handbook</b>. The information in those publications clearly
indicates that the use of U-bolt wire rope clips could significantly damage
wire ropes. Where wire rope is used to secure brackets, U-bolt clips shall
not be used because a segment of damaged dead end could later become part of
the live end due to an increase in the circumference of the structure. By
contrast, the standard allows U-bolts in other applications, such as where
the U-bolt is used at the end (dead end) of the wire rope and that part of
the wire rope is never moved into the live section. Accordingly, because of
the risk of damaging the wire rope, OSHA is prohibiting the use of U-bolt
wire rope clips on repair bracket scaffold support cables.</p>

<p>Final rule paragraph (x)(10) requires employers to ensure that materials are
not dropped to the outside of the supporting structure. This paragraph is
based on Item (j) of the February Notice. In addition, Issue 2 of the
Reopening Notice asked if requirements other than those in proposed
&#167; 1926.451(f) (&#167; 1926.451(h) of the final rule) were needed to address the
hazards of materials falling to the outside of the structure. The NACHS (Ex.
34-33) indicated that chunks of material generated during demolition
operations are "dropped piecemeal down the inside of the chimney and kept off
the scaffold." There was no response to Issue 2. OSHA believes that this
requirement simply codifies existing good industry practice and provides an
appropriate supplement to the provisions of final rule &#167; 1926.451(h).</p>

<p>Final rule paragraph (x)(11) requires that erection of a repair bracket
scaffold be performed in only one direction around the structure. This
provision is based on item (k); as with the other "items" from the February
1, 1994 notice, the Agency believes that this paragraph simply codifies
established good industry practice.</p>

<p>In addition, the February 1, 1994 reopening notice raised several Issues and
Items which did not result in the addition of requirements to the final rule.
For example, Reopening Issue 1 asked how employers would provide a safe
anchorage point for personal fall arrest systems and whether compliance with
the General Industry standard for powered platforms, 1910.66, Appendix C
would be appropriate. The NACHS (Ex. 43-21) stated that a wire rope anchorage
point could be attached to a structure "by means of tensioning devices i.e.,
turnbuckles and hardwood cable spacer (stand off) blocks." The commenter also
stated that conformance with 1910.66, Appendix C, should not be required
"because the chimney bracket scaffold erector is secured to an independent
anchor (ladder) during the installation process." Based on this information,
OSHA has not added the cross-reference to the General Industry standard to
the final rule.</p>

<p>In addition, Item (i) provided for a competent person to inspect the
supporting structure before scaffold erection begins, and Issue 3 asked what
criteria a competent person should apply when inspecting the supporting
structure. The NACHS (Ex. 43-21) stated that the criteria should be
determined by the "competent person" (as defined in existing &#167; 1926.32(f)) and
"should be the responsibility of each contractor on a project by project
basis." Charles Greene (Ex. 43-47) stated that OSHA should require inspection
of wire rope before each use. The Agency believes that compliance with the
general requirements in final rule &#167; 1926.451(f)(3), which provides that a
competent person shall inspect scaffolds (including supporting structures and
anchorage points) for visible defects prior to each work shift and after any
occurrence that could affect the scaffolds' structural integrity, will
provide adequate assurance that unsafe scaffolds are not used. Accordingly,
the Agency has not added additional specific criteria for inspection of
repair bracket scaffolds to the final rule.</p>

<p>Reopening Issue 3 sought comment on the use of a wire rope placed at the
platform level in lieu of an inner guardrail system on tank builders'
scaffolds. The Steel Tank Institute (STI) (Ex. 43-5) stated:</p>

<p>One STI member uses a fabricated hook with an eyelet for attaching a safety
lanyard and harness. The hook is hooked over the top plate of steel on the
tank being erected. This system allows a high degree of mobility for workers
since the hook can slide horizontally along the steel plate, and results in
100&#37; fall protection. If such a system is used, the space between the
scaffold planks and the tank shell should not be an issue.</p>

<p>OSHA believes that, in general, the use of guardrail systems or personal
fall arrest systems would provide more effective protection than the system
described by the STI. The Agency also believes, however, that the method
described by this commenter to use personal fall arrest systems could be used
in many cases to provide protection equivalent to the wire rope guardrail
described in Issue 3.</p>

<p>Reopening Issue 5 asked what criteria, if any, should be set for brackets
used with repair bracket scaffolds. CCI (Ex. 43-1) stated that there was "no
need" to set such criteria. In addition, the NACHS (Ex. 43-21) responded
"[n]o criteria should be set by OSHA that may restrict material and system
improvements that are in constant change due to modern technology." The
Agency agrees that it is important to encourage development of improved
systems and materials. Furthermore, OSHA believes that compliance with the
requirements in final rule &#167;&#167; 1926.451 (a), (b) and (c), will ensure that
brackets used on repair bracket scaffolds provide adequate protection for
employees. Accordingly, the Agency has not added specific criteria for
brackets to the final rule.</p>

<p>Reopening Issue 9 asked whether the safety factor for wire rope used with
repair bracket scaffolds should be 4:1, as recommended by the NACHS (Ex.
34-33), or 6:1, as provided in proposed &#167; 1926.451(a) and in Item (d). OSHA
noted that a 4:1 safety factor might be inadequate because the use of wire
rope clips reduces the strength of the rope. The NACHS (Ex. 43-21) stated
"[t]he Committee unanimously recommends a safety factor of 4:1 be satisfied."
OSHA believes that the strength of wire ropes used with repair bracket
scaffolds is just as important as the strength of ropes used with other
scaffolds. Therefore, the Agency has determined that the 6:1 safety factor
which OSHA has set as a general requirement for wire ropes (final rule
&#167; 1926.451(a)) is also appropriate for wire ropes used with repair brackets.</p>

<p>Reopening Issue 11 asked if OSHA should specify that each platform unit on a
chimney bracket scaffold shall extend at least 12 inches over its supports,
as recommended by NACHS (Ex. 34-33) and provided by Item (f), or extend at
least 6 inches (unless cleated or otherwise restrained) as provided by
proposed &#167; 1926.451(b). CCI (Ex. 43-1) stated that platform units should extend
out at least 12 inches. The NACHS (Ex. 43-21) stated that OSHA should require
minimum extension of 6 inches unless cleated or otherwise restrained as
provided by proposed &#167; 1926.451(b), but did not explain why it had changed its
position. OSHA believes that compliance with the 6-inch requirement as set
forth in final rule &#167; 1926.451(b)(4) will adequately protect employees working
on repair bracket scaffolds.</p>

<p>Items (c) and (h) would have incorporated strength and guardrail
requirements into paragraph (x). These provisions are not needed because the
general requirements in final rule &#167;&#167; 1926.451 (a) and (g) adequately address
scaffold capacity and fall protection.</p>

<p>Item (g) provided that the span of platform units from bracket to bracket
shall not exceed 5 feet on the outside of the brackets. As noted above,
Monsanto (Ex. 43-45) supported the inclusion of this provision in the final
rule. The Agency notes that while span is a factor, the issue is already
addressed by the general requirements for minimum and maximum overhang (final
rule &#167;&#167; 1926.451(b)(4) and (5)), and the capacity requirements of &#167; 1926.451(a).
There is thus no need to add this requirement to the final rule.</p>

<p>Paragraph (y) Stilts</p>

<p>Final rule paragraph (y) provides requirements for the use of stilts.
Neither OSHA's existing scaffold standard (subpart L) nor the proposed rule
directly addressed the use of stilts. NPRM Issue 20 asked if OSHA should
prohibit or regulate the use of stilts. In particular, the Agency requested
suggestions as to the appropriate construction and use of stilts, fall
protection for employees wearing stilts, floor conditions in areas where
stilts are being used, and other necessary considerations.</p>

<p>The SSFI (Ex. 2-367) stated that they "would support OSHA's prohibition on
using stilts while undertaking work on scaffolds" as this "would be
considered unsafe." Another commenter (Ex. 2-29) stated, "stilts are not
recommended for construction conditions. Unlevel working surfaces, debris,
etc. are particular problems when using stilts."</p>

<p>On the other hand, a commenter (Ex. 2-13) stated, "OSHA should not prohibit
the use of stilts. They have been used safely for many years. They should
never be used near any unprotected opening." The SIA (Exs. 2-368, 5a-16)
agreed that the Agency should promulgate a rule permitting the use of stilts
but should spell out "some safety rules, particularly when their use places
the worker at heights above the standard guardrail protection." Many
commenters on Issue 20 used a specific height (length) of no more than 40
inches as a cut off point above which they considered the use of stilts to be
unsafe (Exs. 2-47, 2-61, 2-63, 2-67, 2-78, 2-156, and 2-304).</p>

<p>Over 460 other commenters expressed the view that Issue 20 was the first
step towards a prohibition on the use of stilts. Those comments stated that
prohibiting the use of stilts would cause employees to sustain injuries from
over-reaching and falling from ladders, stools, platforms, homemade benches,
boards, inverted buckets and other devices they would otherwise use to
elevate themselves when doing painting, finishing or ceiling work. In
particular, one commenter (Ex. 2-99) stated</p>

<p>Based on our experiences over these many years, we have found stilts to be a
very safe and effective means to perform work in a timely and efficient and
safe manner. Whenever stilts are used on a project, we have found that
general housekeeping improves. There is much less debris found even on a
short term basis than there would be with conventional scaffolding. We are
able to use stilts to reach areas where conventional scaffolding and even
ladders would be unsafe due to jobsite conditions. We do not let just any
employee work on stilts. Our safety record attests to that. During the twenty
(20) years we have used stilts, we have only had two (2) accidents involving
the stilts--and both of these accidents were by the same employee.</p>

<p>Most of the commenters stressed the need for proper training for employees
who use stilts (Exs. 2-6, 2-301, 2-379, and 2-406B). Most of the comments
also indicated that some safety provisions, such as debris control, are
needed if stilts are to be used.</p>

<p>Based on the concerns expressed by commenters, Issue L-4 of the hearing
notice (53 FR 2048, January 26, 1988) set out four provisions that OSHA was
considering for inclusion in the final rule for subpart L and solicited
public input. Final rule &#167;&#167; 1926.452(y)(1) and (2) address the use of stilts on
large area scaffolds, and &#167;&#167; 1926.452 (y)(3) and (4) provide criteria for the
use of stilts in general. These are based on the first through fourth
provisions, respectively, raised in Hearing Notice Issue L-4.</p>

<p>The Association of the Wall and Ceiling Industries International testified
(Tr. 3/22/88, p. 86, Ex. 5a-14) in favor of the proposed provisions. The SIA
testified that stilt use was widespread and that stilts were considered a
useful tool by the ceiling and wall industries (Tr. 3/22/88, pp. 157-158).
The SIA testimony supported three provisions that OSHA is adopting, but did
not express an opinion on the fourth provision (final paragraph (y)(2)).</p>

<p>Paragraph (y)(1) requires that employees not wear stilts on scaffolds except
when the employees are on large area scaffolds. This paragraph is effectively
identical to the language in the first provision raised for consideration in
Issue L-4.</p>

<p>Paragraph (y)(2) provides, when employees wearing stilts are on large area
scaffolds where guardrail systems are being used, that the dimensions of the
guardrail system shall be increased to offset the height of the stilts. This
paragraph corresponds to the language in the second provision raised for
consideration in Issue L-4.</p>

<p>The SIA (Ex. 2-368) commented that a standard providing for the use of
stilts on scaffolds should address guardrail height on scaffolds where stilts
are being used.</p>

<p>Paragraph (y)(3) of the final rule provides that all surfaces on which
stilts are used shall be flat and free of pits, holes and obstructions, such
as debris, as well as all other tripping and falling hazards. This paragraph
is identical to the language in the third provision raised for consideration
in Issue L-4.</p>

<p>Many commenters noted the importance of removing potential tripping hazards
where stilts are used (Exs. 2-54, 2-71, 2-99, 2-149, 2-166, 2-205, 2-219,
2-256, 2-272, 2-283, 2-295, 2-307, and 2-324). For example, a commenter (Ex.
2-54) stated:</p>

<p>It would seem those that would have the opportunity to use stilts the most
would be stepping into a lot of loose debris that has fallen and quite
vulnerable to injury from slipping and falling.</p>

<p>Paragraph (y)(4) of the final rule provides that stilts shall be properly
maintained and that any alterations of the original equipment must be
approved by the manufacturer. This paragraph is identical to the language in
the fourth provision raised for consideration in Issue L-4.</p>

<p>Several commenters who responded to Issue 20 addressed the condition of
stilts. Those commenters (Exs. 2-59, 2-62, 2-71, 2-72, 2-108, 2-211, 2-219,
2-237, 2-243, 2-301, 2-304, 2-304, 2-313, 2-324, 2-379, 2-406B, and 2-409),
generally, indicated that requirements for proper maintenance and inspection
of stilt equipment, including straps and fittings, were needed. A number of
manufacturers, contractors, and workers who use stilts also expressed strong
approval for the use of manufactured stilts (as opposed to the use of
job-made stilts) (Exs. 2-47, 2-127, 2-154, 2-257, 2-304-25, and 2-411A). The
Agency has no information which indicates that job-made stilts pose a greater
hazard than manufactured stilts, and therefore is not covering them
differently under this paragraph. OSHA will monitor work experience under
this provision to determine if it is appropriate to treat manufactured and
job-built stilts differently.</p>

<p><b class="ITALICS">Section 1926.453 Aerial Lifts</b></p>

<p>OSHA proposed to delete existing &#167; 1926.451(f), <b class="ITALICS">Elevating and rotating work
platforms</b>, because the Agency believed that the existing provision was
redundant with existing &#167; 1926.556, <b class="ITALICS">Aerial lifts</b>, which is in subpart N,
Cranes, Derricks, Hoists, Elevators and Conveyors, of the Construction
Standards. Existing &#167; 1926.451(f) provides only that employers comply with ANSI
A92.2-1969, Vehicle Mounted Elevating and Rotating Work Platforms. This
requirement is also found in &#167; 1926.556. Section 1926.556, in turn, sets some
specific requirements for specified lift operations, but primarily references
ANSI A92.2-1969.</p>

<p>The SIA (Ex. 2-368) objected to the proposed deletion, stating that
equipment which falls under the definition of "scaffold" should be addressed
by subpart L. ANSI A92.2-1969 classifies elevating and rotating work
platforms as "scaffolds."</p>

<p>Based on consideration of the comment, OSHA believes that the retention of
existing &#167; 1926.451(f) would not be appropriate. However, the Agency agrees
with the commenter that this type of equipment is a scaffold and that it
should be addressed by subpart L. In order to facilitate the efforts of
construction employers to safeguard employees who use elevating and rotating
work platforms, the Agency has decided to move the requirements of &#167; 1926.556
to a new &#167; 1926.453, Aerial lifts, in subpart L. The introductory text to this
section indicates that &#167; 1926.453 applies only to ANSI A92.2 type equipment
(vehicle mounted elevating and rotating work platforms), and further notes
that the requirements of &#167;&#167; 1926.451 and 1926.452 do not apply to this type of
equipment.</p>

<p>In addition, OSHA recognizes that the A92 Committee has updated A92.2-1969
and has adopted other A92 standards which address technological advances and
evolving safe industry practices regarding elevating and rotating work
platforms. The Agency has determined that compliance with the pertinent A92
standards adopted by ANSI since 1969 will provide employee safety at least
equivalent to that attained through compliance with ANSI A92.2-1969.
Accordingly, OSHA is providing a list of post-1969 ANSI A92 standards which
are presently available, and is placing this list in a new non-mandatory
Appendix C to this standard (subpart L). This non-mandatory appendix can be
updated as necessary to include future revisions of the A92 standards or
other relevant information.</p>

<p>Paragraph (a) addresses general requirements for aerial lifts, while
paragraph (b) contains specific requirements for this equipment. Paragraph
(b)(1) through (b)(5) specify requirements for ladder trucks and tower
trucks, extensible and articulating boom platforms, electrical tests,
bursting safety factors, and welding standards for aerial lifts, respectively</p>

<p><b class="ITALICS">Section 1926.454 Training Requirements</b></p>

<p>Section 1926.454 addresses training for employees working with scaffolds.
The introductory text indicates clearly that this section both supplements
and clarifies the training provisions in existing &#167; 1926.21(b)(2). That
standard, which applies to all construction work, requires employers to
"instruct each employee in the recognition and avoidance of unsafe conditions
and the regulations applicable to his work environment to control or
eliminate any hazards or other exposure to illness or injury." While that
language clearly articulates the employer's general duty to provide training,
OSHA believes it is appropriate to provide more specific direction regarding
the training necessary for employees who work on scaffolds. Accordingly,
&#167; 1926.454 sets certain criteria allowing employers to tailor training to fit
their workplace circumstances.</p>

<p>The introductory text of proposed &#167; 1926.460 indicated that OSHA would cite
employers for violations of the added training requirements in this section
only when a citation was issued concurrently under the provisions of proposed
&#167; 1926.450, &#167; 1926.451 or &#167; 1926.452. However, it is clear to OSHA that this
approach is not appropriate and does not provide adequate employee
protection, because the training of an employee does not necessarily ensure
that an employee will follow the substantive safety provisions of the
standard in every case.</p>

<p>OSHA's enforcement of the standard's training requirement does not depend on
the extent to which an employer is fulfilling other compliance obligations
under subpart L. In this regard, the scaffold standard is like any other OSHA
standard that provides for both hazard prevention and employee training. The
employer has separate duties to provide protection and to train employees,
and may be cited for violating either or both types of requirements.</p>

<p>Paragraph (a) of the final rule sets training requirements for employers who
have employees working on scaffolds. The introductory text requires employers
to ensure that each employee whose employment involves being on a scaffold is
trained to recognize the hazards associated with the type of scaffold being
used and to understand the procedures which must be followed to control or
minimize those hazards.</p>

<p>Proposed paragraph (a) required that all employees using scaffolds to
perform a job task be instructed in the proper construction, use, placement
and care of the scaffolds they are using, and in the applicable provisions of
this subpart. OSHA has determined that the proposed provision should be
revised to provide more specific direction regarding how employees working on
scaffolds are to be trained. In addition, the Agency recognizes that it is
appropriate to distinguish between the training needed by employees erecting
and dismantling scaffolds and the training needed by employees who are on
scaffolds in the course of their work. Accordingly, final rule paragraph (a)
addresses employees who are working on scaffolds and final rule paragraph (b)
addresses employees who are erecting and dismantling scaffolds. OSHA
anticipates that some employees, such as those who use adjustable suspension
scaffolds, will need training that complies with both paragraph (a) and
paragraph (b).</p>

<p>The SIA and the Duke Power Company (Exs. 2-368 and 2-465) commented that
employees who use scaffolds do not need to know how to construct, place, and
care for these scaffolds. The SIA (Ex. 2-368) stated "Does every single
worker on the job need to know how the scaffold is constructed, or how it was
placed, or how it is to be cared for? This should be the responsibility of
some "competent" person, but not everyone on the scaffold." In addition, Duke
Power (Ex. 2-465) noted "the majority of scaffolds used are not constructed
by the employees using them." As noted above, OSHA agrees with these concerns
and final rule &#167; 1926.454 reflects this thinking.</p>

<p>The introductory language of final rule paragraph (a) also requires
employers to ensure that each affected employee has been trained by a person
who is qualified in the pertinent subject matters. The requirement for
training by a qualified person has been added to the final rule to ensure
that the training is adequate. The ACCSH (Tr. 6/9/87, p. 266) recommended
that OSHA require the involvement of a competent person in the program to
provide appropriate assurance that employees will be adequately trained.
However, the Agency has decided that a qualified person would be more
appropriate because it is the knowledge, skill or experience of the trainer,
not the trainers authority, which determines the adequacy of the training
provided. Limiting the delivery of the required training only to a competant
person would prevent employers from taking advantage of outside sources of
training, such as scaffold manufacturers and suppliers, that regularly
provide these types of services to clients.</p>

<p>Paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(5) address five areas in which training must
be provided, as applicable. Final rule paragraph (a)(1) requires that
affected employees be trained in the nature of any electrical hazards, fall
hazards and falling object hazards in the work area. Many employees have been
killed or seriously injured because they were unaware of workplace hazards or
did not understand the consequences of exposure to those hazards. This
provision clearly indicates the hazards (i.e., electrocution, falls and
falling objects) regarding which training must be provided. This paragraph
elaborates on the requirements of existing &#167; 1926.21(b)(2), which addresses
training in the general recognition and avoidance of hazards.</p>

<p>Final rule paragraph (a)(2) requires that affected employees be trained in
the correct procedures for protection from electrical hazards and for
erecting, maintaining, and disassembling the required fall protection systems
and falling object protection systems. Employees who are on scaffolds while
working need to know how protective systems function, so that they know how
to install, maintain or remove these systems, as necessary. For example,
where a scaffold has been erected without the protective measures necessary
for work to be performed on or from the scaffold, the employees subsequently
coming onto the scaffold would need to install them. Even where the scaffold
erectors have installed the required protection for affected employees, the
employees working on the scaffold need to know when and how to maintain that
protection, so that a hazardous situation does not develop during scaffold
use. Proposed paragraph (a) addressed this subject only in general terms.</p>

<p>The ANSI Z359 Committee stated (Ex. 2-57)</p>

<p>"[P]ersons who work on scaffolds should be required to undergo <b class="ITALICS">fall
protection</b> training. This is not specified in sufficient detail in &#167; 1926.460.
The content, specificity and training environment for a fall protection
training program should perhaps be considered as the subject of a national
standard." OSHA agrees with this comment and has revised the proposed
training provision accordingly.</p>

<p>Paragraph (a)(3) requires that employees be trained in the proper use of the
scaffold and in the proper handling of materials on the scaffold. This
paragraph is effectively identical to the corresponding provision of proposed
paragraph (a). The language regarding the proper handling of materials has
been added to facilitate compliance with the requirements for falling object
protection.</p>

<p>Paragraph (a)(4) requires that employees be trained in the maximum intended
load and the load-carrying capacities of the scaffolds used. This language is
effectively identical with the corresponding language of proposed paragraph
(a).</p>

<p>Paragraph (a)(5) requires that employees be trained in the pertinent
requirements of subpart L. This provision is effectively identical to the
corresponding language in proposed paragraph (a).</p>

<p>Paragraph (b) of the final rule addresses training for employees assembling,
maintaining or dismantling scaffolds. The introductory language of paragraph
(b) requires that the employer have each employee who erects, disassembles,
moves, operates, repairs, maintains, or inspects a scaffold trained by a
competent person so that the employee can recognize any hazards related to
such work duties. This provision is effectively identical to the language in
proposed paragraph (a). As noted above, final rule paragraph (b) is designed
to differentiate clearly between the training needed by employees erecting
and dismantling scaffolds and the training needed by employees who are on
scaffolds in the course of their work. In addition, this provision
corresponds, in part, to the language in proposed paragraph (b), which
required that employees repairing scaffolds be competent individuals "trained
and familiar with the design criteria, intended use, and the proper
procedures for repairing the defective component(s)."</p>

<p>The introductory language of final paragraph (b) requires the employer to
ensure that each affected employee has been trained by a competent person in
four areas, as applicable. As discussed above in relation to final rule
&#167; 1926.454(a), OSHA has added this requirement in response to a recommendation
from the ACCSH (Tr. 266, 2/9/87).</p>

<p>Paragraph (b)(1) requires that affected employees be trained in the nature
of scaffold hazards. This provision effectively restates the existing
&#167; 1926.21(b)(2) requirement that employees be instructed in the recognition and
avoidance of unsafe conditions.</p>

<p>Paragraph (b)(2) requires that affected employees be trained in the correct
procedures for erecting, disassembling, moving, operating, repairing,
inspecting, and maintaining the type of scaffold in question. This language,
which is consistent with the corresponding language in proposed paragraphs
(a) and (b), indicates clearly that training must address the particular
type(s) of scaffold with which each affected employee will be working.
Training provided to an employee to construct, repair or dismantle one type
of scaffold will not necessarily enable that employee to repair another type.</p>

<p>Paragraph (b)(3) requires that affected employees be trained in the design
criteria, maximum load-carrying capacity, and intended use of the scaffold.
This provision is consistent with the corresponding language in final rule
paragraph (a)(4).</p>

<p>Final rule paragraph (b)(4) requires that affected employees be trained in
the pertinent requirements of subpart L. This provision, like final rule
paragraph (a)(5), is effectively identical to the corresponding language in
proposed paragraph (a).</p>

<p>Non-mandatory Appendix D lists various training topics that may be important
for the employers and employees erecting or dismantling scaffolds. The list
is not all-inclusive, and OSHA is providing it solely as informational
guidance. The employer may need to address topics or situations not mentioned
in the Appendix which are specific to the employer's particular
circumstances.</p>

<p>Proposed paragraph (c), which addressed training specifically for employees
who operate suspended scaffolds, has been deleted from the final rule,
because the Agency has determined that training for these employees is
adequately covered by the requirements in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of the
final rule.</p>

<p>Final paragraph (c) requires the employer to retrain any employee when the
employer has reason to believe that the employee does not have the
understanding and skill required by paragraph (a) or (b) of this section.
Employees must be retrained, as necessary, to restore the requisite
scaffold-related proficiency. Circumstances where the provision requires
retraining include, but are not limited to, the following situations: first,
whenever there is a change at the worksite that presents a hazard about which
the employee has not been trained (paragraph (c)(1)(i)); second, where
changes in the types of scaffolds, fall protection, falling object
protection, or other equipment present a hazard about which the employee has
not been trained (paragraph (c)(1)(ii)); and, third, where inadequacies in an
affected employee's work practices involving scaffolds indicate that the
employee has not retained the requisite proficiency (paragraph (c)(1)(iii)).
This provision simply clarifies the language of proposed &#167; 1926.460(d), which
stated that employees would receive training and retraining as necessary.
OSHA notes that this provision is essentially identical to the corresponding
retraining requirements in the Construction Industry fall protection standard
(&#167; 1926.503(d)) and the General Industry standards for permit-required confined
spaces (1910.146(g)(2)) and personal protective equipment (1910.132(f)(3)).</p>

<p>NPRM Issue 15 solicited comments regarding employee training and retraining
on scaffold use. In particular, OSHA asked for data on the costs and
effectiveness of training requirements in reducing the risk of injuries or
fatalities, and whether more or less specific requirements were appropriate.
Commenters were also asked to provide the Agency with information about
currently available safety programs and their adequacy; the safety records of
employees who have been trained; the scope and necessary elements of training
programs; the relationship of the additional specific provisions in proposed
&#167; 1926.460 to the more general &#167; 1926.21 requirements; the costs and benefits of
these provisions; and possible recordkeeping burdens these provisions might
involve.</p>

<p>The SIA (Ex. 2-368) stated: "[T]he SIA devotes a considerable portion of its
budget to promotion of safety and training through audio-visual programs and
training courses for the safe use of scaffolds. We believe that training will
reduce accidents and would like to see some additional requirements in the
scaffold standards." However, the SIA expressed concern that employers would
have to "establish and maintain extensive records on each employee" because
the rule would expose them to "increased liability from an insurance
standpoint" and to OSHA citations. The SIA also indicated that training would
not be able to cover all foreseeable equipment use, and that an employer who
assumed that training was all-encompassing would be compromising the safety
of its employees. Furthermore, the SIA stated that the proposed training
requirements would pose practical problems for employers because of employee
mobility and related staffing concerns.</p>

<p>Based on the above-discussed concerns, the SIA made the following
recommendations regarding `additional' training requirements:</p>

<p>As a minimum, employers should be required to furnish to employees working
on scaffolds printed safety rules (Codes of Safe Practice) for the particular
type scaffold they are using. The employee should be required to read the
rules in the presence of the employer or his agent (a competent person) and
be questioned as to whether the employee understands the rules.</p>

<p>Due to the extreme hazard associated with the use of suspended scaffolds, a
written training program should be required. The program should include
formal certification by the employer upon completion of the program by the
employee. Persons without such training should not be allowed to work on
suspended scaffolds.</p>

<p>OSHA notes that the training requirements in both the final rule and the
proposed rule have been framed in performance-oriented language. This
approach allows employers the flexibility to establish programs which
reconcile the need for training with the circumstances at particular
workplaces.</p>

<p>The AGC (Exs. 2-20, 2-55, and 2-390) contended that any additional training
requirements would be redundant and economically infeasible, given the
construction industry's high employee turnover. The GLFEA and ABC (Exs. 2-22
and 2-69) commented that training requirements would "impose practical
problems" due to workforce mobility. In addition, the GLFEA, ABC and the
Builders' Association of Missouri (Ex. 2-50) stated that the requirements of
&#167; 1926.21 already adequately address training. The GLFEA added that "other
constraints * * * such as insurance costs and workers compensation rates,
impose a requirement on * * * employers to train their employees and * * *
follow safety requirements."</p>

<p>OSHA recognizes that employee turnover can increase an employer's training
responsibilities. The Agency notes, however, that the existing standard
already requires construction employers to provide training for their
employees, notwithstanding employee turnover or other day-to-day changes in
the employer's workforce. Furthermore, the Agency believes that &#167; 1926.454,
insofar as it elaborates on the training requirements of existing
&#167; 1926.21(b)(2), simply codifies good industry practice and provides useful
direction for how training programs can "do it right." Accordingly, OSHA has
determined, based on the rulemaking record, that any additional
responsibilities imposed by final rule &#167; 1926.454 are reasonable and necessary
to protect employees from serious hazards.</p>

<p>Furthermore, employers need not retrain employees who are trained by a
previous employer or were trained prior to the effective date of the
standard, as long as the employee demonstrates the proficiency required by
the pertinent provisions of this section. This approach is consistent with
that taken in part 1910, subpart I (Personal protective equipment) and part
&#167; 1926, subpart M (Fall protection).</p>

<p>A manufacturer of suspended scaffolds, Sky Climber, recommended (Ex. 2-64)
requiring that all riggers and operators of suspension scaffold equipment be
formally trained and certified and carry a certificate or license to evidence
their completion of training. That commenter provided the following to
explain their position:</p>

<p>Improper rigging and operator error were the second and third major cause
and cost of our product incidents. We believe that training of operators and
riggers will substantially reduce the frequency and cost of incidents. In
fact, of the over 1500 persons who complete our Training Program in
operation, maintenance and rigging since 1980, to our knowledge, not one has
been involved in a suspension scaffold incident.</p>

<p>Sky Climber added that this training should be mandatory, and since "[t]he
primary responsibility for training rests with the employer * * * he or some
other qualified party should provide the required training."</p>

<p>Seedorff Masonry Inc.(Ex. 2-407) commented</p>

<p>We have always used our foreman as the instructor and this has worked out
very well. We can agree that there could be an additional rule on this point,
however additional paperwork would not be feasible. We could find our
superintendents only doing paperwork without enough time to oversee job sites
and develop good safety on the job sites.</p>

<p>The SSFI (Ex. 2-367) commented in favor of proposed &#167; 1926.460, stating as
follows:</p>

<p>Members of the SSFI are in full support of the training requirements for the
contractor provided within the OSHA revision. If followed, the training
requirements would reduce the number of accidents on construction projects.
There currently exist many Institute Safety Rules and Recommendations as well
as many recommendations developed by the manufacturers of the equipment. As a
minimum, those requirements can be used and, if followed, should dramatically
reduce the accidents of construction employees. These construction employees
should be trained by the contractor at the construction site prior to their
actual start of work, and should not be trained on-the-job as they are
working.</p>

<p>Alum-A-Pole Corporation, a manufacturer of pumpjack scaffolds, stated (Ex.
2-31) "[o]n-the-job training is the mode in which pumpjack users gain
proficiency in proper installation. On that basis, sequential pictorial
instructions with minimal verbiage * * * if adhered to, would virtually
eliminate accidents."</p>

<p>Two commenters (Exs. 2-2 and 2-13) expressed the view that cost should not
be an issue in matters of safety. In addition, one of these commenters (Ex.
2-13) found from his own experience that both employers and employees should
be trained and retrained.</p>

<p>Another commenter (Ex. 2-54) supported training and retraining and provided
details of the commenter's training program. The comment touched on the value
of discussions, involving both workers and apprentices, regarding the proper
way to use equipment. In particular, the commenter indicated that employees
are more productive when they are confident that they have the right
equipment and know how to use it.</p>

<p>In addition, discussion by the ACCSH on Issue 15 noted that training is
cost-effective and beneficial for both employees and employers (Tr. 6/9/87,
pp. 130-136). One member stated: "I've heard several employers state that
these training programs save 4 to 5 percent of the gross cost of the project,
which oftentimes is more than double the amount that they got the bid by in
the first place.</p>

<p>They might have gotten the bid by less than 2 percent, but they save 5
percent with the proper training program."</p>

<p>Issue L-1 of the hearing notice (53 FR 2049) requested testimony and related
information on any current training programs which issue certificates or
licenses to indicate that employees have been adequately trained to erect,
use or dismantle specific types of scaffolds. The Agency indicated that it
was considering adding a requirement for verification of compliance through a
written certification. In particular, OSHA sought comment on the following
language:</p>

<p>&#167; 1926.461 Certification. (a) The employer shall certify that all employees
who are erecting, maintaining and dismantling scaffolds, have been adequately
trained in the appropriate precautions and safe practices before they are
allowed to perform any such scaffold work.</p>

<p>(b) The employer shall certify that the employee has been trained by
preparing a certification record which includes the identity of the person
trained, the signature of the employer or the person who conducted the
training, and the date the training or retraining was completed. The
certification record shall be prepared at the completion of training and
shall be maintained on file for the duration of the employee's employment.
The certification record shall be made available upon request to the
Assistant Secretary for Occupational Safety and Health or designee.</p>

<p>Issue L-1 stated that the above language would not require the "collection
of information," and would not, therefore, impose a paperwork burden on the
employer under the terms of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. Chapter
35) and the implementing regulations (5 CFR 1320.7(j)).</p>

<p>The Association of Wall and Ceiling Industries (AWCI) (Ex. 9; Tr. 3/22/88,
p. 83-84) testified that certifying somebody as adequately trained "opens up
a potential of increased liability so what I'm asking OSHA to do for us is to
provide some definition of `adequately trained.' Whether this is a model
training program or perhaps a listing of the subjects to be covered under
this adequacy of training and also some indication of who's going to do the
training." AWCI also asked whether any employee who works on a scaffold must
be trained in its proper construction, placement, and care.</p>

<p>The AWCI (Ex. 9; Tr. 3/22/88, p. 84-85) also noted that, given the constant
exchange of employees in the construction industry, "portability" of training
was a point of concern. They questioned, for example, whether a contractor
who has trained employees on a project and rehires them a month and half
later would have to retrain them. Similarly, in response to a question
regarding the type of training scaffold erectors typically receive, AWCI
stated that:</p>

<p>* * * most of it is on-the-job training that's handed down to new employees
as they come aboard the company or is brought by the employees from the
previous company. The training programs could have been derived from the
manufacturer of the scaffolding equipment, could be derived from the in-house
training program that the contractor has and some of these contractors have
extensive programs in place on-site. It could also be derived from the
scaffold industry association * * * programs that they have in place * * * "
(Ex. 9; Tr. 3/22/88, pp. 91-92.)</p>

<p>The AWCI further testified (Ex. 9; Tr. 3/22/88, p. 90) that EPA's asbestos
abatement certification program provided "[t]he ground floor of employee
protection." They pointed out that the program requires 3 days of classroom
training, including some "hands-on," and includes a listing of all points the
program is to cover. In addition, the AWCI testified that "[the program]
gives employees an added margin of safety by making them aware of the hostile
environment they're going to be in, and added that a foreman, contractor, or
supervisor must go for an additional day of training and that they receive
instruction regarding insurance programs and legal ramifications." When asked
to comment on EPA's certification program versus that which might be required
for scaffold erection, the AWCI replied (Tr. 3/22/88, p. 91) that OSHA should
specify the points "to be covered in the training program and the credentials
of the trainer" if OSHA is going to require a certification program.</p>

<p>In addition, Bristol Steel (Ex. 13; Tr. 3/23/88, pp. 2-147 and 2-148) stated
that certification is a weighty responsibility with significant legal
implications. Bristol Steel also contended that any legal liability arising
from a certification program should be the burden of a trade organization
(Tr. 3/23/88, pp. 2-181-182).</p>

<p>Bristol Steel also stated (Ex. 13) that the proposed certification
requirement would add a paperwork burden to employers. The commenter added
that before requiring certification, OSHA should show that such a requirement
could be "implemented and universally enforced and will cause a material
reduction in scaffold accidents."</p>

<p>The SIA testified (Ex. 10; Tr. 3/22/88 p. 151) that a certification
requirement would expose employers to "tremendous liability to civil and even
criminal negligence suits in addition to those penalties prescribed under
OSHA." The SIA added that they "worked closely with Cal-OSHA in developing a
certification program in 1981, which had to be abandoned because the SIA and
its members could not assume the liability created by Cal-OSHA's insistence
that we `certify the competency of the worker'."</p>

<p>The Montague-Betts Company, Inc. and SEAVAC testified that training and
certification of workers using scaffolds were appropriate and useful, but
that "a lot of definition of scope and what certification consists of is
necessary before * * * people can take a final position as to the complete
merits and workings of such a proposal" (Tr. 3/23/88, pp. 2-198).
Montague-Betts (Ex. 5a-5) stated that certification of employees using
scaffolds is appropriate. On the other hand, SEAVAC (Ex. 5a-17) stated that
certification is appropriate for employees who erect or dismantle scaffolds
but not for other employees.</p>

<p>The SSFI (Ex. 5a-19) stated that training for individuals who use and erect
scaffolds had been a subject of great debate within the institute and stated
that their members were "very supportive of a [s]tandard that would require
training for the use, erection, and dismantling of scaffolds." They
recommended the following elements for training:</p>

<UL>
<p>--Two categories of training: one for scaffold users and one for scaffold
erectors and dismantlers;</p>

<p>--Issuing employee "qualification cards" that could be presented to employers,
and which would certify completion of a sanctioned training program;</p>

<p>--Nationally uniform training programs;</p>

<p>--A national program requiring certification to balance economic consideration among
contractors;</p>

<p>--A gradual transition for the implementation of such a training
program;</p>

<p>--Permitting vocational trades, technical, or other qualified teaching
organizations or contractors to provide this type of training service;</p>

<p>--Not allowing training and certification to be substituted for
existing safety requirements, such as those provided by the equipment
manufacturer.</p>
</UL>

<p>Some commenters opposed the certification language in Issue L-1. One (Ex.
2-593) indicated that the training requirements in &#167; 1926.21 and proposed
&#167; 1926.460 were sufficient. Another (Ex. 2-594) called the section regarding
certification "too restrictive." Monsanto (Ex. 2-595) disagreed with
certification of training and retention of the certification in a file.
Monsanto indicated that it had not had problems with scaffold erection,
maintenance, and dismantling that would warrant certification of training.
They added that the proposed retention requirement for certification
information documents would "present an unwarranted paperwork burden on the
employer."</p>

<p>The Edison Electric Institute (Ex. 5a-6) responded that a written
certification was unnecessary and would add a significant paperwork burden
for employers. EEI added that regular training would assure that employees
know how to safely "handle scaffolds." EEI also stated that the work involved
in these operations is not so sophisticated that routine training should be
considered inadequate.</p>

<p>OSHA has determined, based on its review of the record, that a written
certification would impose an additional burden on employers without a
demonstrable increase in worker safety. OSHA can determine if workers have
been adequately trained by talking with the employees and observing their
work habits. In addition, the Paperwork Reduction Act, as recently revised,
classifies certification as a type of information burden for which OSHA must
present a justification. Given the Agency's conclusion that the necessary
information can be obtained without referring to documents, such a burden
would not be justified. Therefore, the final rule will not contain a
requirement for training certification.</p>

<p>IV. Economic Assessment and Regulatory Flexibility Analysis</p>

<p><b class="ITALICS">Introduction</b></p>

<p>Executive Order (EO) 12866 requires regulatory agencies to conduct an
economic analysis for rules that meet certain criteria. The most frequently
used criterion under EO 12866 is that the rule will impose annual costs on
the economy of &#36;100 million or more. OSHA's final standard for scaffolds in
construction does not meet this criterion, or any of the other criteria
specified by EO 12866, and therefore does not require an economic analysis.
Nevertheless, OSHA has decided to conduct such an analysis to provide the
regulated community with as much information about the rule as possible. The
Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, as amended in 1996, requires OSHA to
determine whether the Agency's regulatory actions will have a significant
impact on a substantial number of small entities. Making this determination
requires OSHA to perform a screening analysis to identify any such impacts.
Consistent with these requirements, OSHA has prepared this economic analysis
and regulatory flexibility screening analysis of the final rule for scaffolds
in construction. The final rule being published today will replace the
outdated consensus standard addressing scaffolds in construction that was
adopted by OSHA in 1971 and has remained largely unchanged since then.</p>

<p>This analysis includes a description of the industries affected by the
regulation, an evaluation of the risks addressed, an assessment of the
benefits attributable to the final standard, a determination of the
technological feasibility of the new requirements, an estimate of the costs
of compliance with the standard, a determination of the economic feasibility
of compliance with the standard, and an analysis of the economic and other
impacts associated with this rulemaking, including those on small businesses.
The following is a summary of this analysis, which is available from OSHA's
docket office.</p>

<p><b class="ITALICS">The Final Standard for Scaffolds in Construction</b></p>

<p>This final standard for scaffolds in the construction industry makes many
changes to the consensus standard adopted by OSHA in 1971 and codified at 29
CFR 1926.450 to 1926.453 (Subpart L of OSHA's construction industry
standards). Appendix A of the Final Economic Analysis compares, on a
provision-by-provision basis, the final standard with the standard that has
been on the books since 1971. In this economic analysis, the standard being
published today is referred to as the final standard, while the standard it
replaces is termed the "existing" standard.</p>

<p>One of the important distinctions between the two standards is the clarity
and simplicity of the final standard, which is written in language that
people in the construction industry use to describe scaffolds and their
components. Technical terms required to convey information accurately and
unambiguously are defined clearly in paragraph (b) of final rule &#167; 1926.450.
The final rule also updates the regulatory text to reflect changes in
technology that have occurred in the quarter century since the existing
standard was written. These changes will permit scaffold manufacturers and
users to benefit from technological change and give them additional
flexibility in using up-to-date equipment. The final standard also clarifies
and resolves issues of terminology or areas of confusion that have been
identified by scaffold users over the years. In the past, OSHA has addressed
implementation problems of this sort in letters of interpretation or
compliance memoranda or directives; the final standard corrects and revises
the provisions that gave rise to these interpretations. Finally, the final
standard adds protection for employees using scaffolds. The principal areas
in the new standard that have been strengthened are employee training,
protection from electrical hazards, and procedures for employees engaged in
the erection and dismantling of scaffolds. These requirements reflect OSHA's
long experience in accident investigation in the construction industry, as
well as an extensive analysis of the leading causes of scaffold-related
fatalities and injuries.</p>

<p><b class="ITALICS">Affected Industries</b></p>

<p>The requirements of the final standard apply to all establishments in the
construction industry. As classified by the 1987 Standard Industrial
Classification (SIC) manual, the industry can be divided into three broad
types of activities: building construction general contractors (SIC 15),
heavy construction general and special trade contractors (SIC 16), and
construction by other special trade contractors (SIC 17).</p>

<p>There are 572,850 establishments in the construction sector employing
approximately 4.7 million employees. Small establishments with one to nine
employees, which represent 82 percent (or 469,349) of establishments,
collectively employ only 1.4 million employees (30 percent). The number of
construction workers is estimated to be approximately 3.6 million. OSHA
estimates that there are approximately 2.34 million construction workers (65
percent of all construction workers) who frequently work on scaffolds and who
would be affected by the final standard for scaffolds.</p>

<p><b class="ITALICS">Evaluation of Risk and Potential Benefits</b></p>

<p>Of the 510,500 injuries and illnesses reportedly occurring in the
construction industry annually, an estimated 9,750 are related to scaffolds.
Similarly, of the estimated 924 occupational fatalities occurring annually
among construction employees, at least 79 fatalities are associated with work
on scaffolds. OSHA estimates that the new requirements in the final rule will
prevent 47 of these fatalities and 4,455 of these injuries annually; these
numbers are above and beyond the fatalities and injuries that would be
prevented if construction employers complied with OSHA's existing scaffold
standard. OSHA estimates that the total value of the cost savings associated
with this revised standard is &#36;90 million per year. This estimate of cost
savings considers only those scaffold related injuries that involve lost
workdays.</p>

<p><b class="ITALICS">Costs and Technological Feasibility</b></p>

<p>The total estimated costs associated with the final standard amount to about
&#36;12.62 million annually. The largest single cost (&#36;5.85 million) is
associated with inspections of non-suspended scaffolds before use. The
remaining costs are attributable to requirements for additional training for
employees exposed to potential hazards involving work on scaffolds (&#36;5.30
million) and for fall protection for employees erecting and dismantling
scaffolds(1) (&#36;1.47 million). Table ES-1 shows the annual costs of compliance
associated with the final rule.</p>

<p>(1) This requirement has a one year delayed implementation date.
Because the requirements of the final standard can be met with existing
equipment and methods, the standard is technologically feasible.</p>

<p><b class="ITALICS">Economic Impacts</b></p>

<p>Compliance with the requirements of the final standard has been determined
to be economically feasible and is not expected to produce significant
adverse economic impacts on firms in the construction industry. The estimated
compliance costs represent less than 0.002 percent of construction revenues.
Given the minimal price increase necessary to cover the costs of the final
standard, employers should be able to pass these compliance costs on their
customers. However, even if all costs were absorbed by the affected firms (a
highly unlikely scenario), the average reduction in profits would be only
0.04 percent.</p>

<p><b class="ITALICS">Regulatory Flexibility Screening Analysis</b></p>

<p>Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 as amended (5 U.S.C. 601
et seq.), OSHA has assessed the small-business impact of the final standard
for scaffolds used in construction, and has certified based on that
assessment and the underlying data, that the standard will not have a
significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. The controlling
consideration for a regulatory flexibility analysis is whether the standard
would impose significant economic impacts on a substantial number of small
entities. The significance of any economic impact is measured by the effect
on profits, market share, and an entity's financial viability.</p>

<p>The small establishment size standards established by the U.S. Small
Business Administration (SBA) for the construction industry, which are based
on establishment receipts, are &#36;17 million for establishments in SICs 15 and
16, and &#36;7 million for establishments in SIC 17. Of the 572,850
establishments affected by the revised standard, 493,637<a NAME="text1"></a>
<a HREF="#footnote1"><SUP>(1)</SUP></a> establishments,
or about 86 percent of all construction establishments, are considered small
establishments as defined by the SBA.</p>

<p>OSHA assessed the potential economic impacts of the rule on all affected
establishments and has concluded that the rule is economically feasible and
will not impose a substantial burden on construction employers. As indicated
above, firms would only have to increase the price charged for their services
by, at most, 0.002 percent of the value of their sales in order to recover
the money they expended on compliance. In the unlikely event that firms could
not pass any of these costs to their customers and had to absorb all of the
costs themselves (a highly unlikely scenario), the average reduction in
profits caused by these costs would be only 0.04 percent. On average, the
value of receipts for establishments in the construction industry is
estimated to be &#36;1.12 million. Firms with sales in this range clearly fall
within the SBA size standard.</p>

<p>To ensure that even the smallest firms in this industry would not be
significantly impacted by the costs of compliance associated with the final
standard, OSHA also examined the financial profile for small construction
establishments with 9 or fewer employees at the four-digit SIC code level,
which constitutes the overwhelming majority of firms in this industry. To
examine the impact of the standard on the smallest and potentially most
affected firms, OSHA made a series of extreme-case assumptions: that all
employees in these establishments use scaffolds in the course of their work
and that these establishments have not implemented any of the new work
practices or procedures required by the final rule. In addition, OSHA assumed
that two employees at each firm would require fall protection systems and
training in the erection and dismantling of supported-scaffolds. Assuming a
baseline turnover rate of 15 percent, and using the formulas presented in
Chapter V of the Economic Analysis, such a small establishment, which
represents an extreme-case impact situation, would incur compliance costs of
<a NAME="text2">&#36;603</a><a HREF="#footnote2"><SUP>(2)</SUP></a> annually.</p>

<p>Table ES-2 presents the results of this extreme-case analysis. It shows
estimated compliance costs and economic impacts relative to revenues and
pre-tax income for small businesses by four-digit SIC code level. OSHA
compared the baseline financial data for these firms with OSHA's estimate of
the standard's annual compliance cost by computing compliance costs as a
percentage of revenue. This approach (Table ES-2) reflects extreme case
impacts because it assumes that employers have to recover the costs of
achieving compliance by increasing their prices. Under this full cost
pass-through scenario, the maximum average expected price increase required
to recover the full costs of compliance with this standard would be extremely
small, approximately 0.1 percent. The four-digit industry estimated to
experience the highest potential price increase would be Painting and Paper
Hanging (SIC 1721), where firms could have to increase prices by 0.18
percent. Again, since these impacts are based on extreme-case costs, they are
likely to be overestimating.</p>

<p>Under the second scenario used to test the impacts of actions on
markets--the no cost pass-through scenario--firms are assumed not to be able
to pass any of their costs through to their customers in the form of price
increases. If no costs can be passed on, firms would have to absorb these
costs entirely from their profits (a highly unlikely scenario). Using this
assumption, the average expected decline in profits for these very small
firms would be only 1.44 percent. The largest potential impact of the
standard would be anticipated in the Plastering, Drywall and Acoustical
industry (SIC 1742), where firms could experience a decline in profits of
2.71 percent. Such impacts are not large enough to be significant because
they mean, for example, that the profit rate for such a company would decline
only from 5.0 percent to 4.9<a NAME="text3"></a>
<a HREF="#footnote3"><SUP>(3)</SUP></a> percent. As noted, these figures are based on
highly conservative assumptions and are therefore likely to overestimate
standard's impact.</p>

<p>Because fixed costs, such as those for preparing training materials, are
larger as a percentage of revenues the smaller the firm, the smallest firms
will experience the greatest economic impacts. If the smallest firms, with
extreme-case costs, will experience no significant impact, it is reasonable
to conclude that larger firms will not experience significant economic
impacts. Thus, because this standard will not have a significant impact
either on the smallest establishments (those with 9 or fewer employees) or on
the typical establishment in this industry, OSHA certifies that this final
standard will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities, as defined by the SBA.</p>

Ratios 1994-95) x conversion formula based on the federal corporate tax
schedule.</p>

<p>[c] Annual cost of compliance of 603 per establishment assumes that all
workers (5) would require training in the initial year and that all new
workers in subsequent years would require training. Two workers will be
trained in dismantling and erecting procedures. Estimates also assume that
fall protection will be required for erectors and dismantlers and that
inspections of non-suspended scaffolds will be required.</p>

<p>nec=Not elsewhere classified.</p>

<p>In addition, OSHA has drafted the final standard for scaffolds in the
construction industry to achieve adequate protection for affected employees
while imposing minimal impacts on small employers. For example, the final
rule maintains the performance-oriented approach of the proposed standard,
allowing employers the flexibility to take workplace conditions into account
when framing their compliance strategies. In addition, OSHA considered and
adopted several alternatives designed to minimize small business impacts. For
example, revisions reflected in the final standard's requirements for fall
protection (grandfathering existing guardrail systems and allowing some use
of crossbracing in lieu of guardrails) will enable small entities to minimize
their compliance burdens. Accordingly, OSHA has determined that the final
rule effectively addresses small employer concerns.</p>

<p>V. Environmental Assessment</p>

<p><b class="ITALICS">Finding of No Significant Impact</b></p>

<p>This final rule and its major alternatives have been reviewed in accordance
with the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969
(42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.), the Guidelines of the Council on Environmental
Quality (CEQ) (40 CFR part 1500), and OSHA's DOL NEPA Procedures (29 CFR part
11). As a result of this review, the Assistant Secretary for OSHA has
determined that the final rule will have no significant environmental impact.</p>

<p>The revisions to Subpart L--Scaffolds focus on the reduction of accidents or
injuries by means of work practices and procedures, proper use and handling
of equipment, and training, as well as on changes in language, definition,
and format of the standard. These revisions do not impact on air, water, or
soil quality, plant or animal life, the use of land, or other aspect of the
environment. As such, these revisions are, therefore, categorized as excluded
actions according to subpart B, 11.10, of the DOL NEPA regulation.</p>

<p>VI. Pertinent Legal Authority</p>

<p>The purpose of the Occupational Safety and Health Act, 29 U.S.C. 651 et seq.
("the Act"), is "to assure so far as possible every working man and woman in
the Nation safe and healthful working conditions and to preserve our human
resources." 29 U.S.C. 651(b). To achieve this goal, Congress authorized the
Secretary of Labor to promulgate and enforce occupational safety and health
standards. 29 U.S.C. 655(a) (authorizing summary adoption of existing
consensus and federal standards within two years of Act's enactment), 655(b)
(authorizing promulgation of standards pursuant to notice and comment),
654(b) (requiring employers to comply with OSHA standards).</p>

<p>A safety or health standard is a standard "which requires conditions, or the
adoption or use of one or more practices, means, methods, operations, or
processes, reasonably necessary or appropriate to provide safe or healthful
employment." 29 U.S.C. 652(8).</p>

<p>A standard is reasonably necessary or appropriate within the meaning of
Section 652(8) if it substantially reduces or eliminates significant risk,
and is economically feasible, technologically feasible, cost effective,
consistent with prior Agency action or a justified departure, supported by
substantial evidence, and is better able to effectuate the Act's purposes
than any national consensus standard it supersedes. See 58 Fed. Reg.
16612-16616 (March 30, 1993).</p>

<p>OSHA has generally considered, at minimum, a fatality risk of 1/1000 over a
45-year working lifetime to be a significant health risk. See the Benzene
standard, <b class="ITALICS">Industrial Union Dep't v. American Petroleum Institute</b>, 448 U.S.
607, 646 (1980); the Asbestos standard, <b class="ITALICS">Building and Constr. Trades Dep't,
AFL-CIO v. Brock</b>, 838 F.2d 1258, 1265 (D.C. Cir 1988); the Formaldehyde
standard, <b class="ITALICS">International Union, UAW v. Pendergrass</b>, 878 F.2d 389, 392 (D.C.
Cir 1989).</p>

<p>A standard is technologically feasible if the protective measures it
requires already exist, can be brought into existence with available
technology, or can be created with technology that can reasonably be expected
to be developed. <b class="ITALICS">American Textile Mfrs. Institute v. OSHA</b>, 452 U.S. 490, 513
(1981) ("<b class="ITALICS">ATMI</b>"); AISI v. OSHA, 939 F.2d 975, 980 (D.C. Cir. 1991).</p>

<p>A standard is economically feasible if industry can absorb or pass on the
costs of compliance without threatening its long term profitability or
competitive structure. See <b class="ITALICS">ATMI</b>, 452 U.S. at 530 n. 55; <b class="ITALICS">AISI</b>, 939 F.2d at
980.</p>

<p>A standard is cost effective if the protective measures it requires are the
least costly of the available alternatives that achieve the same level of
protection. ATMI, 453 U.S. at 514 n. 32; International Union, UAW v. OSHA, 37
F.3d 665, 668 (D.C. Cir. 1994) ("<b class="ITALICS">LOTO III</b>").</p>

<p>Section 6(b)(7) authorizes OSHA to include among a standard's requirements
labeling, monitoring, medical testing and other information gathering and
transmittal provisions. 29 U.S.C. 655(b)(7).</p>

<p>All standards must be highly protective. See 58 Fed. Reg. at 16614-16615;
<b class="ITALICS">LOTO III</b>, 37 F.3d at 669. Finally, whenever practical, standards shall "be
expressed in terms of objective criteria and of the performance desired." <b class="ITALICS">Id</b>.</p>

<p>VII. Recordkeeping</p>

<p>The Agency has estimated the paperwork burden of the final rule entitled
"Scaffolds Used in the Construction Industry" under the guidelines of the
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. Under that Act, burden is defined as the
total time, effort, or financial resources expended by persons to generate,
maintain, retain, or disclose or provide information to or for a Federal
Agency. The Agency has concluded that there is only one collection of
information in the final rule on "Scaffolds Used in the Construction
Industry" that potentially could create a burden [as defined above] for the
construction industry. The collection of information in located in
&#167; 1926.453(a)(2). This provision requires the employer to obtain a written
certification from the manufacture of aerial lifts under certain specified
conditions. In particular, the requirement reads as follows:</p>

<p>Aerial lifts may be "field modified" for uses other than those intended by
the manufacturer provided the modification has been certified in writing by
the manufacturer or by any other equivalent entity, such as a nationally
recognized testing laboratory, to be in conformity with all the applicable
provisions of the ANSI A92.2-1969 and this section and to be at least as safe
as the equipment was before modification.</p>

<p>This provision was adopted by OSHA in May 1971 as an established Federal
standard which had been promulgated by the Bureau of Labor Standards for the
Construction Industry in April 1971. OSHA failed to identify this provision
as subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA-95) and did not obtain
approval from OMB for this collection as required by PRA-95. This error was
discovered in the course of preparing the final rule for Scaffolds Used in
the Construction Industry. This provision, currently located in
&#167; 1926.556(a)(2) is redesignated as &#167; 1926.453(a)(2) and removed unchanged from
its present location in Subpart N to Subpart L (Scaffolds Used in the
Construction Industry). Through this final rule, OSHA is soliciting comments
on the burden associated with the collection. It is OSHA intent to review and
analyze all comments received on the collection of information and then to
seek proper approvals from OMB under PRA-95. Once approval is received, OSHA
will publish a notice in the Federal Register to indicate the OMB Approval
Number and the effective date of the provision.</p>

<p><b class="ITALICS">Collections of Information: Request for Comments</b></p>

<p>The Department of Labor, as part of its continuing effort to reduce
paperwork and respondent burden, conducts a preclearance consultation program
to provide the general public and Federal agencies with an opportunity to
comment on proposed and/or continuing collections of information in
accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA95) (44 U.S.C.
3506(c)(2)(A)). This program helps to ensure that requested data can be
provided in the desired format, reporting burden (time and financial
resources) is minimized, collection instruments are clearly understood, and
the impact of collection requirements on the respondents can be properly
assessed. Currently, OSHA is soliciting comments concerning the proposed
approval for the paperwork requirements of 29 CFR part 1926, subpart L,
Scaffolds used in the Construction Industry. Written comments should:</p>

<UL>
<LI><p>Evaluate whether the proposed collection of information is necessary for
the proper performance of the function of the agency, including whether the
information will have a practical utility;</p></LI>

<LI><p>Evaluate the accuracy of the Agency's estimate of the burden of the
proposed collection of information, including the validity of the methodology
and assumptions used;</p></LI>

<LI><p>Enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be
collected; and</p></LI>

<LI><p>Minimize the burden of the collection of information on those who are to
respond, including through the use of appropriate automated, electronic,
mechanical, or other technological collection techniques or other forms of
information technology, e.g., permitting electronic submissions of responses.</p></LI>
</UL>

<p><b class="ITALICS">Background</b></p>

<p>OSHA in its final rule for Scaffolds Used in the Construction Industry is
redesignating existing &#167; 1926.556 (subpart N), Aerial Lifts to &#167; 1926.453
(subpart L), Aerial Lifts because these type of equipment are, in fact,
scaffolds. The existing regulation, &#167; 1926.556(a)(2), contained a requirement
for manufacturer certification of "field modified" aerial lifts. This
provision, along with the rest of 1296.556, is being redesignated
&#167; 1926.453(a)(2) in this final rule.</p>

<p>OSHA believes that manufacturer certification of "field modified"</p>

<p>aerial lifts is necessary to ensure that modifications to these types of
scaffolds will not adversely affect the strength, stability, or other
characteristics necessary for their safe use.</p>

<p>VIII. State Plan Standards</p>

<p>The 25 states and territories with their own OSHA-approved occupational
safety and health plans must adopt a comparable standard within 6 months of
the publication date of the final rule. These states and territories are:
Alaska, Arizona, California, Connecticut (for State and local government
employees only), Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan,
Minnesota, New York (for State and local government employees only), Nevada,
New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, Puerto Rico, South Carolina, Tennessee,
Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Virgin Islands, Washington, and Wyoming. Until such
time as a comparable standard is promulgated, Federal OSHA will provide
interim enforcement assistance, as appropriate, in these states and
territories.</p>

<p>IX. Federalism</p>

<p>The final rule has been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12612
(52 FR 41685, October 30, 1987) regarding Federalism. The Order requires that
agencies, to the extent possible, refrain from limiting State policy options,
consult with states prior to taking any actions that would restrict State
policy options, and take such actions only when there is clear constitutional
authority and the presence of a problem of national scope. The Order provides
for preemption of State law only if there is a clear Congressional intent for
the agency to do so. Any such preemption is to be limited to the extent
possible.</p>

<p>Section 18 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSH Act), expresses
Congress' clear intent to preempt State laws relating to issues with respect
to which Federal OSHA has promulgated occupational safety and health
standards. Under the OSH Act, a State can avoid preemption only if it
submits, and obtains Federal approval of a plan for the development of such
standards and their enforcement. Occupational safety and health standards
developed by such Plan States must, among other things, be at least as
effective in providing safe and healthful employment and places of employment
as the Federal standards. Where such standards are applicable to products
distributed or used in interstate commerce, they may not unduly burden
commerce and must be justified by compelling local conditions, see section
18(c)(2).</p>

<p>The Federal standard on construction operations involving scaffolds
addresses hazards that are not unique to any one state or region of the
country. Nonetheless, States with occupational safety and health plans
approved under section 18 of the OSH Act will be able to develop their own
State standards to deal with any special problems which might be encountered
in a particular State. Moreover, because this standard is written in general,
performance-oriented terms, there is considerable flexibility to State plans
to require, and for affected employers to use, methods of compliance which
are appropriate to the working conditions covered by the standard.</p>

<p>In brief, this final rule addresses a clear national problem related to
occupational safety and health in the construction industry. Those states
which have elected to participate under section 18 of the OSH Act are not
preempted by this standard, and will be able to address any special
conditions within the framework of the Federal Act while ensuring that the
state standards are at least as effective as that standard.</p>

performance of work, and only after the utility company, or electrical system
operator, has been notified of the need to work closer and the utility
company, or electrical system operator, has deenergized the lines, relocated
the lines, or installed protective coverings to prevent accidental contact
with the lines.</p>

<p>(7) Scaffolds shall be erected, moved, dismantled, or altered only under the
supervision and direction of a competent person qualified in scaffold
erection, moving, dismantling or alteration. Such activities shall be
performed only by experienced and trained employees selected for such work by
the competent person.</p>

plywood.</p>

<p>(p) <b class="ITALICS">Two-point adjustable suspension scaffolds.</b> (1) In addition to direct
connections to buildings (except window cleaners' anchors) acceptable ways to
prevent scaffold sway include angulated roping and static lines. Angulated
roping is a system of platform suspension in which the upper wire rope
sheaves or suspension points are closer to the plane of the building face
than the corresponding attachment points on the platform, thus causing the
platform to press against the face of the building. Static lines are separate
ropes secured at their top and bottom ends closer to the plane of the
building face than the outermost edge of the platform. By drawing the static
line taut, the platform is drawn against the face of the building.</p>

<p>(2) On suspension scaffolds designed for a working load of 500 pounds, no
more than two employees shall be permitted on the scaffold at one time. On
suspension scaffolds with a working load of 750 pounds, no more than three
employees shall be permitted on the scaffold at one time.</p>

<p>(3) Ladder-type platforms. The side stringer shall be of clear
straight-grained spruce. The rungs shall be of straight-grained oak, ash, or
hickory, at least 1 1/8 inches in diameter, with 7/8 inch tenons mortised
into the side stringers at least 7/8 inch. The stringers shall be tied
together with tie rods not less than 1/4 inch in diameter, passing through
the stringers and riveted up tight against washers on both ends. The flooring
strips shall be spaced not more than 5/8 inch apart, except at the side rails
where the space may be 1 inch. Ladder-type platforms shall be constructed in
