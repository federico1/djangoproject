VII. Recordkeeping
<p>
The Agency has estimated the paperwork burden of the final rule entitled
"Scaffolds Used in the Construction Industry" under the guidelines of the
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. Under that Act, burden is defined as the
total time, effort, or financial resources expended by persons to generate,
maintain, retain, or disclose or provide information to or for a Federal
Agency. The Agency has concluded that there is only one collection of
information in the final rule on "Scaffolds Used in the Construction
Industry" that potentially could create a burden [as defined above] for the
construction industry. The collection of information in located in
1926.453(a)(2). This provision requires the employer to obtain a written
certification from the manufacture of aerial lifts under certain specified
conditions. In particular, the requirement reads as follows:
<p>
Aerial lifts may be "field modified" for uses other than those intended by
the manufacturer provided the modification has been certified in writing by
the manufacturer or by any other equivalent entity, such as a nationally
recognized testing laboratory, to be in conformity with all the applicable
provisions of the ANSI A92.2-1969 and this section and to be at least as safe
as the equipment was before modification.
<p>
This provision was adopted by OSHA in May 1971 as an established Federal
standard which had been promulgated by the Bureau of Labor Standards for the
Construction Industry in April 1971. OSHA failed to identify this provision
as subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA-95) and did not obtain
approval from OMB for this collection as required by PRA-95. This error was
discovered in the course of preparing the final rule for Scaffolds Used in
the Construction Industry. This provision, currently located in
1926.556(a)(2) is redesignated as 1926.453(a)(2) and removed unchanged from
its present location in Subpart N to Subpart L (Scaffolds Used in the
Construction Industry). Through this final rule, OSHA is soliciting comments
on the burden associated with the collection. It is OSHA intent to review and
analyze all comments received on the collection of information and then to
seek proper approvals from OMB under PRA-95. Once approval is received, OSHA
will publish a notice in the Federal Register to indicate the OMB Approval
Number and the effective date of the provision.
<p>
Collections of Information: Request for Comments
<p>
The Department of Labor, as part of its continuing effort to reduce
paperwork and respondent burden, conducts a preclearance consultation program
to provide the general public and Federal agencies with an opportunity to
comment on proposed and/or continuing collections of information in
accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA95) (44 U.S.C.
3506(c)(2)(A)). This program helps to ensure that requested data can be
provided in the desired format, reporting burden (time and financial
resources) is minimized, collection instruments are clearly understood, and
the impact of collection requirements on the respondents can be properly
assessed. Currently, OSHA is soliciting comments concerning the proposed
approval for the paperwork requirements of 29 CFR part 1926, subpart L,
Scaffolds used in the Construction Industry. Written comments should:
<p>
* Evaluate whether the proposed collection of information is necessary for
the proper performance of the function of the agency, including whether the
information will have a practical utility;
<p>
* Evaluate the accuracy of the Agency's estimate of the burden of the
proposed collection of information, including the validity of the methodology
and assumptions used;
<p>
* Enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be
collected; and
<p>
* Minimize the burden of the collection of information on those who are to
respond, including through the use of appropriate automated, electronic,
mechanical, or other technological collection techniques or other forms of
information technology, e.g., permitting electronic submissions of responses.
<p>
Background
<p>
OSHA in its final rule for Scaffolds Used in the Construction Industry is
redesignating existing 1926.556 (subpart N), Aerial Lifts to 1926.453
(subpart L), Aerial Lifts because these type of equipment are, in fact,
scaffolds. The existing regulation, 1926.556(a)(2), contained a requirement
for manufacturer certification of "field modified" aerial lifts. This
provision, along with the rest of 1296.556, is being redesignated
1926.453(a)(2) in this final rule.
<ul>OSHA believes that manufacturer certification of "field modified"</ul>
<p>
aerial lifts is necessary to ensure that modifications to these types of
scaffolds will not adversely affect the strength, stability, or other
characteristics necessary for their safe use.
<p>
