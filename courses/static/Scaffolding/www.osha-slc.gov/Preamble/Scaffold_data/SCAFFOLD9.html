IX. Federalism
<p>
The final rule has been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12612
(52 FR 41685, October 30, 1987) regarding Federalism. The Order requires that
agencies, to the extent possible, refrain from limiting State policy options,
consult with states prior to taking any actions that would restrict State
policy options, and take such actions only when there is clear constitutional
authority and the presence of a problem of national scope. The Order provides
for preemption of State law only if there is a clear Congressional intent for
the agency to do so. Any such preemption is to be limited to the extent
possible.
<p>
Section 18 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSH Act), expresses
Congress' clear intent to preempt State laws relating to issues with respect
to which Federal OSHA has promulgated occupational safety and health
standards. Under the OSH Act, a State can avoid preemption only if it
submits, and obtains Federal approval of a plan for the development of such
standards and their enforcement. Occupational safety and health standards
developed by such Plan States must, among other things, be at least as
effective in providing safe and healthful employment and places of employment
as the Federal standards. Where such standards are applicable to products
distributed or used in interstate commerce, they may not unduly burden
commerce and must be justified by compelling local conditions, see section
18(c)(2).
<p>
The Federal standard on construction operations involving scaffolds
addresses hazards that are not unique to any one state or region of the
country. Nonetheless, States with occupational safety and health plans
approved under section 18 of the OSH Act will be able to develop their own
State standards to deal with any special problems which might be encountered
in a particular State. Moreover, because this standard is written in general,
performance-oriented terms, there is considerable flexibility to State plans
to require, and for affected employers to use, methods of compliance which
are appropriate to the working conditions covered by the standard.
<p>
In brief, this final rule addresses a clear national problem related to
occupational safety and health in the construction industry. Those states
which have elected to participate under section 18 of the OSH Act are not
preempted by this standard, and will be able to address any special
conditions within the framework of the Federal Act while ensuring that the
state standards are at least as effective as that standard.
