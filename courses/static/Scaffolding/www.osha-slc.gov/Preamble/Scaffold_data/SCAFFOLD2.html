II. Hazards Involved
<p>
Scaffold-related incidents resulting in injuries and fatalities continue to
occur despite the fact that OSHA has had a scaffold standard (existing
subpart L) in place since 1971 (Exs. 1, 2, 3, 42, 43, 44 and 45). However,
the Agency believes that compliance with the standard being published today
will be better than it has been in the past because this standard has been
simplified, brought up to date, and strengthened to provide additional
protection.
<p>
Although specific accident ratios cannot be projected for the estimated 3.6
million construction workers currently covered by subpart L, the Economic
Analysis that accompanies this final rule estimates that, of the 510,500
injuries and illnesses that occur in the construction industry annually,
9,750 are related to scaffolds. In addition, of the estimated 924
occupational fatalities occurring annually, at least 79 are associated with
work on scaffolds.
<p>
OSHA prepared the following statistical estimates (based on 4.5 million
construction workers then covered by subpart L) to support the 1986 proposal
for subpart L, based on a review of accident data prepared by the Bureau of
Labor Statistics (BLS) (Ex. 3-1). The revised scaffold standards contain a
number of provisions designed specifically to address the findings of this
analysis.
<p>
a. Seventy-two percent of the workers injured in scaffold accidents covered
by the BLS study attributed the accident either to the planking or support
giving way, or to the employee slipping, or being struck by a falling object.
Plank slippage was the most commonly cited cause.
<p>
b. About 70 percent of the workers learned of the safety requirements for
installing work platforms, assembling scaffolds, and inspecting scaffolds
through on-the-job training. Approximately 25 percent had no training in
these areas.
<ul>c. Only 33 percent of scaffolds were equipped with a guardrail. The
following are recent examples, from the OSHA Integrated Management
Information System (IMIS) data, of the types of accidents that continue to
injure and kill employees working on scaffolds.</ul>
<p>
* In July, 1991, two employees were working on a pump jack scaffold doing
roofing work. The scaffold became overloaded and broke. The employees fell 12
feet to the ground, resulting in one fatality and one serious injury.
<p>
* In August, 1992, two workers were erecting an aluminum pump jack scaffold.
As they were raising the second aluminum pole, the pole apparently contacted
an overhead power line. The pole being raised was 29 feet 10 inches long and
the line was 28 feet 10 inches high. The line was approximately 11 feet from
the house. One employee died and the other suffered severe burns and was
hospitalized. The surviving employee noted that he thought they had enough
room to work around the power lines, which were not de-energized or shielded.
<p>
* In July, 1993, a foreman climbed up the frame of a 45 foot high tubular
welded frame scaffold to check on an employee who was sandblasting inside a
stack at a steam plant. The scaffold was not equipped with guardrails and
there was no access ladder. After talking to the employee, the foreman either
fell from the unguarded platform or fell while climbing down the scaffold end
frame, resulting in his death. There were no witnesses to the fall.
<p>
Based on its analysis of the available data and its field experience in
enforcing construction standards, the Agency has determined that employees
using scaffolds are exposed to a significant risk of harm. Specifically,
scaffold related fatalities still account for approximately 9% of all
fatalities in the construction workplace. In addition, the above data
indicate that the revised final standard would have prevented many of these
accidents more effectively than compliance with the existing scaffold
standards. Consequently, OSHA finds that the revision of its scaffold
standards for construction is necessary to improve employee protection. OSHA
has determined that, as revised, the standard clearly states employers'
duties and the appropriate compliance measures.
<p>
For additional discussion of incidence rates, significance of risk, and the
protectiveness of the final rule, see Section IV, Summary of the Final
Economic Analysis.
