V. Environmental Assessment
<p>
Finding of No Significant Impact
<p>
This final rule and its major alternatives have been reviewed in accordance
with the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969
(42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.), the Guidelines of the Council on Environmental
Quality (CEQ) (40 CFR part 1500), and OSHA's DOL NEPA Procedures (29 CFR part
11). As a result of this review, the Assistant Secretary for OSHA has
determined that the final rule will have no significant environmental impact.
<p>
The revisions to Subpart L -- Scaffolds focus on the reduction of accidents
or injuries by means of work practices and procedures, proper use and
handling of equipment, and training, as well as on changes in language,
definition, and format of the standard. These revisions do not impact on air,
water, or soil quality, plant or animal life, the use of land, or other
aspect of the environment. As such, these revisions are, therefore,
categorized as excluded actions according to subpart B, 11.10, of the DOL
NEPA regulation.
