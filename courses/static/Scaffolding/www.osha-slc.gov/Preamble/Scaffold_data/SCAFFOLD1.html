I. Background
<p>
Congress amended the Contract Work Hours Standards Act (40 U.S.C. 327 et
seq.) in 1969 by adding a new section 107 (40 U.S.C. 333) to provide
employees in the construction industry with a safer work environment and to
reduce the frequency and severity of construction accidents and injuries. The
amendment, commonly known as the Construction Safety Act (CSA), significantly
strengthened employee protection by authorizing the promulgation of
construction safety and health standards for employees of the building trades
and construction industry working on federal and federally-financed or
federally-assisted construction projects. Accordingly, the Secretary of Labor
issued Safety and Health Regulations for Construction in 29 CFR part 1518 (36
FR 7340, April 17, 1971).
<p>
The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (the OSH Act) (29 U.S.C. 651
et seq.) authorized the Secretary of Labor to adopt established federal
standards issued under other statutes, including the CSA, as occupational
safety and health standards. Accordingly, the Secretary of Labor adopted the
Construction Standards, which had been issued under the CSA, as OSHA
standards (36 FR 10466, May 29, 1971). The Safety and Health Regulations for
Construction were subsequently redesignated as 29 CFR part 1926 (36 FR 25232,
December 30, 1971). Standards addressing scaffolds, 1926.451 and 1926.452,
were adopted in subpart L of part 1926 as OSHA standards as part of this
process.
<p>
Various amendments were made to subpart L during the first two years of the
OSH Act. The amendments revised scaffold provisions that addressed planking
grades, wood pole scaffold construction, overhead protection, bracket
scaffold loading, and plank spans. Also, substantive provisions concerning
pump jack scaffolds, height of catch platforms, and guardrails were added (37
FR 25712, December 2, 1972).
<p>
Based on concerns regarding the effectiveness of the existing scaffold
standards, OSHA began a complete review of subpart L in 1977. The Agency
consulted the Advisory Committee on Construction Safety and Health (ACCSH)
several times regarding draft revisions to subpart L. The transcripts of
these meetings are part of the public record for this rulemaking (Ex. 3-4).
OSHA addresses specific recommendations from the ACCSH, as well as those
submitted by other rulemaking participants, in the Summary and Explanation
section, below.
<p>
On November 25, 1986, OSHA issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) on
scaffolds used in construction (51 FR 42680). The proposal set a period,
ending February 23, 1987, during which interested parties could submit
written comments or request a hearing. The Agency twice granted requests for
more time to submit comments and hearing requests. OSHA first extended the
comment and hearing request period to June 1, 1987 (52 FR 5790, February 26,
1987) and then extended that period to August 14, 1987 (52 FR 20616, June 2,
1987). OSHA received 602 comments on the proposal, along with several hearing
requests.
<p>
On January 26, 1988, OSHA announced that it would convene an informal public
hearing on March 22, 1988 to elicit additional information on specific issues
related to scaffolds, fall protection and stairways and ladders (53 FR 2048).
The informal public hearing was held on March 22-23, 1988, with
Administrative Law Judge Joel Williams presiding. At the close of the
hearing, Judge Williams set a period, ending May 9, 1988, for the submission
of additional comments and information. OSHA received 31 submissions,
including testimony and documentary evidence, in response to the hearing
notice. On August 11, 1988, Judge Williams certified the rulemaking record,
including the hearing transcript and all written submissions to the docket,
thereby closing the record for this proceeding.
<p>
In 1988, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), an organization
which sets voluntary consensus standards, approved a revision of ANSI
A10.8-1977, Scaffolding, updating its safety requirements for the use of
scaffolds in construction and demolition operations. Section 6(b)(8) of the
OSH Act requires that when an OSHA standard differs substantially from an
existing national consensus standard, the Secretary must publish "a statement
of the reasons why the rule as adopted will better effectuate the purposes of
the Act than the national consensus standard."  In compliance with that
requirement, OSHA has reviewed the requirements of this final rule with
reference to the corresponding provisions of ANSI A10.8-1988. The Agency
discusses the relationship between the provisions of subpart L and
corresponding provisions of ANSI A10.8-1988 in the Summary and Explanation,
below.
<p>
On March 29, 1993, OSHA reopened the rulemaking record for subpart L (58 FR
16509) to obtain additional comments and information regarding fall
protection and safe means of access for employees erecting and dismantling
scaffolds; the use of crossbraces in scaffold systems; and the use of repair
bracket scaffolds. The comment period was scheduled to end on May 28, 1993.
On May 26, 1993, the Agency extended the comment period (58 FR 30131) to June
29, 1993, in response to a request for additional time to submit comments.
OSHA received 46 comments in response to the March 29 notice. Those comments
are discussed below in relation to the pertinent provisions of the final
rule.
<p>
On February 1, 1994, OSHA again reopened the rulemaking record (59 FR 4615)
to obtain comments and information regarding scaffold stairways; repair
bracket scaffolds; tank builder scaffolds; a NIOSH study of workplace
fatalities; and scaffold-related material incorporated from the proposed part
1910, subpart D rulemaking. The comment period, which ended on March 18,
1994, elicited 46 comments. Those comments are also discussed below in
relation to the pertinent provisions of the final rule.
<p>
A wide range of employers, businesses, labor unions, trade associations,
state governments, and other interested parties contributed to the
development of this record. OSHA appreciates these efforts to help develop a
rulemaking record that provides a sound basis for the promulgation of revised
subpart L.
<p>
Based on its review of existing subpart L, OSHA believes that certain
provisions in the existing standards are outdated, redundant, or ambiguous.
In addition, some types of scaffolds used in construction (e.g., catenary
scaffolds) are not clearly addressed by the existing standards, and some
provisions cover only certain types of scaffolds when they should apply to
all. The final rule eliminates those unnecessary, outdated and redundant
provisions (e.g., revised subpart L states the requirement for guardrails
once, rather than 19 separate times as in the existing standard).
<p>
OSHA is coordinating the revision of part 1926, subpart L, with the ongoing
rulemakings initiated to revise the General Industry (part 1910, subpart D)
and Shipyard (part 1915, subpart N) scaffold standards, so that those
standards will be consistent, where appropriate.
