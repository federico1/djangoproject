                <p>Scissor lifts are mobile supported scaffold work platforms used to safely move workers vertically and to different locations in a variety of industries including construction, retail, entertainment and manufacturing. Scissor lifts are different from aerial lifts because the lifting mechanism moves the work platform straight up and down using crossed beams functioning in a scissor-like fashion. Although scissor lifts present hazards similar to scaffolding when extended and stationary, using scissor lifts safely depends on considering equipment capabilities, limitations and safe practices.</p>

                                            Employers need to assess the worksite to identify all possible hazards  in order to select the appropriate equipment for the task. Employers who use  scissor lifts need to evaluate and implement effective controls that address  fall protection, stabilization and positioning. Only&nbsp;<strong>trained workers  are allowed to use scissor lifts, and employers must make sure that those  workers show that they can use a scissor lift properly</strong>. Safe scissor lift  use includes properly maintaining the equipment, following the manufacturer’s  instructions, providing workers training and needed personal protective  equipment (PPE), and implementing safe work practices.

                                            <p>During the 2010 college football season, a student who was also an employee of the University of Notre Dame was killed while filming the school’s football team practice from a scissor lift. Reportedly, the untrained worker raised the lift over 39 feet to film the practice.</p>
                                            <p>The wind gusts that day were more than 50 miles per hour. The high winds blew the lift over, killing the worker.</p>

                                        <p>Employers should ensure that scissor lifts are stable and will not tip over or collapse. Some safe work practices to ensure safe, stable conditions for scissor lift use include:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for safe movement—this usually rules out moving the lift in an elevated position.</li>
                                            <li>Isolate the scissor lift or implement traffic control measures to ensure that other equipment cannot contact the scissor lift.</li>
                                            <li>Select work locations with firm, level surfaces away from hazards that can cause instability (e.g., drop-offs, holes, slopes, bumps, ground obstructions, or debris).</li>
                                            <li>Use the scissor lift outside only when weather conditions are good.</li>
                                            <li>Scissor lifts rated for outdoor use are generally limited to wind speeds below 28 miles per hour.</li>

                                            <li>Never allow the weight on the work platform to exceed the manufacturer’s load rating.</li>
                                            <li>Never allow equipment other than the scissor mechanism to be used to raise the work platform (e.g., using a forklift to lift the work platform).</li>
                                            <li>Keep the lift from being struck by other moving equipment on the worksite.</li>

                                        <p>Positioning the scissor lift to avoid crushing or electrocution hazards is important for safe use.</p>
                                        <p>Crushing hazards are present in workplaces using scissor lifts and may expose workers nearby, even those not working on the scissor lift.</p>
                                        <p>
                                            Scissor lifts present crushing hazards similar to vehicles and other mobile equipment at worksites. Employers should train workers to be watchful when:
                                        </p><ul>
                                            <li>A moving scissor lift is near a fixed object.</li>
                                            <li>A moving vehicle and the scissor lift are operating closely.</li>
                                            <li>The scissor lift passes under a fixed object, such as a door frame or a support beam.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p>Positioning the scissor lift to avoid electrocution, arc flash, and thermal burns is important for safely using scissor lifts near energized power lines. Since electricity can arc or jump from the power line to the scissor lift or worker, electrocution can occur even if neither the scissor lift nor the worker touches the power line.</p>
                                        <p>
                                            The following work practices ensure that scissor lifts are safely positioned:
                                        </p><ul>
                                            <li>Implement  traffic control measures around the scissor lift to prevent other workers or  vehicles from getting too close.</li>
                                            <li>Use ground guides when operating or moving the scissor lift around the workplace.</li>
                                            <li>Select  work locations that do not approach electrical power sources (e.g., power  lines, transformers) by at least 10 feet and that do not pose other overhead  hazards (e.g., other utilities, branches, overhangs, etc.).</li>
                                            <li>If the job task requires work near an electrical source, the employer must ensure that the worker is qualified and has received the required electrical training.  </li>
                                        </ul>
