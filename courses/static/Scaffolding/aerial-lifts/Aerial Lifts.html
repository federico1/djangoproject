                <p>An aerial lift is any vehicle-mounted device used to elevate personnel. Types include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Extendable boom platforms,</li>
                    <li>Aerial ladders,</li>
                    <li>Articulating (jointed) boom platforms,</li>
                    <li>Vertical towers, and</li>
                    <li>Any combination of the above.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Aerial lifts have replaced ladders and scaffolding on many job sites due to their mobility and flexibility. They may be made of metal, fiberglass reinforced plastic, or other materials. They may be powered or manually operated, and are considered to be aerial lifts whether or not they can rotate around a primarily vertical axis.</p>
                <p>Many workers are injured or killed on aerial lifts each year. OSHA provides the following information to help employers and workers recognize and avoid safety hazards they may encounter when they use aerial lifts.</p>

Only trained workers in general industry and authorized workers in construction may be allowed to use aerial lifts, and employers  must make sure that those workers show that they can use an aerial lift properly. Safe aerial lift use includes properly maintaining the equipment, following the manufacturer’s instructions, providing workers training and needed PPE, and implementing safe work practices.</p>

                                        <p>Insulated aerial lifts offer protection from electric shock and electrocution by isolating you from electrical ground. However, an insulated aerial lift does not protect you if there is another path to ground (for instance, if you touch another wire).To maintain the effectiveness of the insulating device, do not drill holes in the bucket.</p>
