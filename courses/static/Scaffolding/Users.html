            <p>Scaffold users are workers whose work requires them to be supported by scaffolding to access the area of a structure where that work is performed.</p>
            <p><strong>Training and Competent Person Requirements</strong></p>
            <p>Employers are required by OSHA standards to have a qualified person provide training to each employee who performs work while on a scaffold. The training must enable employees to recognize the hazards associated with the type of scaffold being used and to understand the procedures to control or minimize those hazards.</p>
            <p>OSHA defines a qualified person as one who:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Possesses a recognized degree, certificate, or professional standing, or,</li>
                <li>By extensive knowledge, training, and experience has successfully demonstrated the ability to solve or resolve problems relating to the subject matter, the work, or the project</li>
            </ul>
