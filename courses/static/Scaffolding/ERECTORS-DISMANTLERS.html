            <p>Erectors and dismantlers are workers whose principal activity involves assembling and disassembling scaffolding before other work can begin, and after that work, or a portion of it, has been completed.</p>
            <p><strong>Training and Competent Person Requirements</strong></p>
            <p>OSHA requires employers to provide training by a competent person to each employee who is involved in erecting and/or disassembling a scaffold. A competent person is defined as one who:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Is capable of identifying existing and  predictable hazards.</li>
                <li>Has authorization to take prompt corrective  measures to eliminate such hazards.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Requirements for Designing and Constructing Scaffolds</strong></p>
            <p>Scaffolds must be designed by a qualified person and be constructed and loaded in accordance with that design. OSHA defines a qualified person as one who:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Possesses a recognized degree, certificate, or professional standing, or</li>
                <li>By extensive knowledge, training, and experience has successfully demonstrated the ability to solve or resolve problems relating to the subject matter, the work, or the project</li>
            </ul>
            <p>A qualified person must do adequate preplanning to assure the safe erection and use of the scaffold. Preplanning includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Determining the type of scaffold necessary for  the job.</li>
                <li>Determining the maximum load for the scaffold.</li>
                <li>Assuring a good foundation.</li>
                <li>Avoiding electrical hazards.</li>
            </ul>
