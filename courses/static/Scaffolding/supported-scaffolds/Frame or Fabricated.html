                <p>Fabricated frame scaffolds are the most common type of scaffold because they are versatile, economical, and easy to use. They are frequently used in one or two tiers by residential contractors, painters, etc., but their modular frames can also be stacked several stories high for use on large-scale construction jobs. <em>NOTE</em>: Except where indicated, the same basic scaffold requirements that appear in this module also apply to manually propelled, pump jack, ladder jack, tube and coupler, and pole scaffolds, as well as the specialty scaffolds described in Supported Scaffolds. Additional requirements for these scaffolds can be found in their respective modules.</p>

Several days later, a crew of seven workers was instructed to replace the scaffold and finish painting the sign. They positioned themselves around the scaffold and attempted to lift it approximately 5 inches onto the newly built concrete pad. As they were lifting the scaffold, the top section partially separated from the adjoining section, toppled over, and contacted a power line. A 28-year old carpenter and a 31-year old laborer were electrocuted. The other five workers were hospitalized with electrical burns.</li>

                                        <li>A tubular, welded-frame scaffold, 31 feet high, was erected to paint a 33-foot high sign at the entrance of a new shopping mall. After the sign had been partially painted, the scaffold was moved to allow concrete to be placed around the sign. Several days later, a crew of seven workers was instructed to replace the scaffold and finish painting the sign. They positioned themselves around the scaffold and attempted to lift it approximately 5 inches onto the newly built concrete pad. As they were lifting the scaffold, the top section partially separated from the adjoining section, toppled over, and contacted a power line. A 28-year old carpenter and a 31-year old laborer were electrocuted. The other five workers were hospitalized with electrical burns.</li>

                        <p>Workers are most vulnerable to fall hazards when climbing on or off a scaffold. Therefore, employers are required to provide safe scaffold access. Erectors and dismantlers face additional access problems due to the incomplete condition of the scaffolding. Requirements to prevent falls that apply only to these workers are addressed separately below.</p>
                        <p><em>NOTE</em>: Except where indicated, these requirements also apply to manually propelled, pump jack, ladder jack, tube and coupler, and pole scaffolds, as well as the specialty scaffolds described in the Supported Scaffolds module.</p>

                        <p>Once a scaffold is built, even if it is compliant with every other standard relating to footings, structure, capacity, etc., it still will not provide a safe work platform if it does not remain upright. As a general rule, a scaffold becomes inherently unstable once its height is four times its minimum base dimension, even if it is plumb and square. Extreme weather or damage to structural components can also affect a scaffold's stability.</p>

The scaffold was constructed on a poured concrete floor and had been leveled. Each section of the framework measured 6'5" high. The working surface was solidly planked. When the employee tried to set the third level frame into the pins of the second level, the frame he was trying to position   flipped to one side. The momentum of the frame thrust the employee backward off the second level. He fell to the ground, sustaining a fatal blow to his head.</li>
