<p><strong>Case Reports</strong></p>
<p>The following Case 
  Reports of falls investigated by OSHA illustrate how seemingly innocent workplace 
  activities can have deadly consequences.
<ul>
  <li>An employee 
    taking measurements was killed when he fell backward from an unguarded balcony 
    to the concrete 9½ feet below.</li>
  <li>A roofer, handling 
    a piece of fiberboard, backed up and tripped over a 7½ inch parapet. &nbsp; 
    He fell more than 50 feet to ground level and died of severe head injuries.</li>
  <li>Two connectors 
    were erecting light weight steel I-beams on the third floor of a 12-story building, 
    54 feet above the ground.&nbsp; One employee removed a choker sling from a 
    beam and then attempted to place the sling onto a lower hook on a series of 
    stringers. &nbsp; While the crawler tower crane was booming away from the 
    steel, the wind moved the stringer into the beam the employee was standing 
    on.&nbsp; The beam moved while the employee was trying to disengage the hook, 
    causing him to lose his balance and fall to his death.</li>
</ul>
