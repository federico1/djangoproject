                        A controlled access zone is a work area in which certain types of work may take place without
                        using conventional fall protection systems. Worker access to these areas must be carefully
                        controlled. For example, a controlled access zone would be designated where overhand bricklaying
                        was occurring without the protection of guardrails. In this example, only masons and other
                        workers actually engaged in the bricklaying would be allowed in the controlled access zone.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When used to control access to areas where leading edge and other operations are taking place,
                        the controlled access zones must be defined by a control line or by any other means that
                        restricts access. 29 CFR 1926.502(g)(1).

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When control lines are used to define a controlled access zone, they must be erected at least 6
                        feet and no more than 25 feet from the unprotected or leading edge, except when precast concrete
                        members are being erected. In the latter case, the control line is to be erected at least 6 feet
                        and no more than 60 feet or half the length of the member being erected, whichever is less, from
                        the leading edge. 29 CFR 1926.502(g)(1)(i) and (ii).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The control line must extend along the entire length of and approximately parallel to the
                        unprotected side or leading edge and be connected on each side to a guardrail system or wall. 29
                        CFR 1926.502(g)(1)(iii) and (iv).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When controlled access zones are used to limit access to areas where overhand bricklaying and
                        related work are taking place:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                A control line must be erected to define the work zone and must be erected at least 10
                                feet and no more than 15 feet from the working edge. 29 CFR 1926.502(g)(2)(i).
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The control lines must be erected approximately parallel to the working edge and must
                                extend for a distance sufficient to enclose all workers performing overhand bricklaying
                                and related work at the working edge. 29 CFR 1926.502(g)(2)(ii).

                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Additional control lines must be erected at each end of the controlled access zone to
                                enclose the work area. 29 CFR 1926.502(g)(2)(iii).
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Only workers engaged in overhand bricklaying or related work are permitted in the
                                controlled access zone. 29 CFR 1926.502(g)(2)(iv).

                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Control lines must consist of ropes, wires, tapes, or equivalent materials, and supporting
                        stanchions. When used, each control line must:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Be flagged or otherwise clearly marked at not more than 6-foot intervals with
                                high-visibility material. 29 CFR 1926.502(g)(3)(i).

                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Be rigged and supported in such a way that the lowest point (including sag) is not less
                                than 39 inches from the walking or working surface; and the highest point is not more
                                than 45 inches, or more than 50 inches when overhand bricklaying operations are being
                                performed, from the walking or working surface. 29 CFR 1926.502(g)(3)(ii).

                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Have a breaking strength of at least 200 pounds. 29 CFR 1926.502(g)(3)(iii).
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        On floors and roofs where guardrail systems are not in place prior to the beginning of overhand
                        bricklaying operations, controlled access zones must be enlarged as necessary to enclose all
                        points of access, material handling areas, and storage areas. 29 CFR 1926.502(g)(4).

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        On floors and roofs where guardrail systems are in place but need to be removed to allow
                        overhand bricklaying work or leading edge work to take place, only that portion of the guardrail
                        necessary to accomplish that dayâ€™s work is allowed to be removed. 29 CFR 1926.502(g)(5).
