                When we talk about fall prevention, the focus is usually on the individuals working from heights.
                However, a similar concept applies to the tools those workers use.
                <br>   <br>
                Take, for example, this 2014 story out of New Jersey: A delivery truck driver lost his life during a
                stop at a construction site when a tape measure—dropped from 50 stories above ground—struck him in the
                head. Reports indicate the tape measure fell some 500 feet at speeds reaching 140 miles per hour.

                <br><br>

                Similar to fall protection for a worker, tethering a tool involves using a rope or lanyard to connect the tool to an anchor point. Then, should the worker accidentally drop the tool, it only falls a few inches and not all the way to the ground. This greatly reduces the risk the tool will strike anyone who happens to be below the elevated work space. In addition, the employee who dropped the tool can easily retrieve it and resume work. Otherwise, even if the tool hadn’t hit anyone, the employee who dropped it either has to stop work and locate a replacement or head all the way to ground level to retrieve the original.
                <br><br>
                Before work begins, evaluate tools for potential fall or drop hazard. Then take a lanyard with the appropriate clips and connect one end to the tool and the other to a tool belt, wrist band, scaffolding, or other nearby structure. Some tools may have a loop attached at the handle or incorporated into the tool itself to clip the lanyard to. For those that don’t, your workers can use wrap tape or heat shrinking devices to make the tools ready for tethering.
                <br><br>
                Workers should avoid connecting tools weighing more than five pounds to their tool belt or wrist band. The excess weight could affect their balance and add to the injury risk while working from heights. It’s best to tether heavier tools to the structure, scaffolding, or aerial lift unit.
