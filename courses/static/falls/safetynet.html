                </TABLE><p>Where 
        workers on a construction site are exposed to vertical drops of 6 feet 
        or more, OSHA requires that employers provide fall protection in one of 
        three ways <em>before</em> work begins:&nbsp;
              
                
             
              <ul>
        <li> Placing 
          guardrails around the hazard area,&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Install safety nets, or&nbsp;</li>
        <li> Providing 
          personal fall arrest systems for each employee.&nbsp;</li>
              </ul>
      <p>Many times 
        the nature and location of the work will dictate the form that fall protection 
        takes.&nbsp; If the employer chooses to use a safety net system, he must 
        comply with the following provisions:
      <ul>
        <li>Safety 
          nets must be installed as close as practicable under the surface on which employees are working, but in no 
          case more than 30 feet below.&nbsp; </li>
        <li>When nets 
          are used on bridges, the potential fall area must be unobstructed.</li>
        <li>Safety 
          nets must extend outward from the outermost projection 
          of the work surface as follows:</li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li>Safety 
          nets must be installed with sufficient clearance to 
          prevent contact with the surface or structures under them when subjected 
          to an impact force equal to the drop test described below.</li>
        <li>Safety 
          nets and their installations must be capable of absorbing an 
          impact force equal to the drop test described below.</li>
        <li>Safety 
          nets and safety net installations must be drop-tested 
          at the jobsite:  
          <ul>
            <li>After 
              initial installation and before being used.</li>
            <li>Whenever 
              relocated.</li>
            <li>After 
              major repair.</li>
            <li>At 
              6-month intervals if left in one place.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The drop 
          test consists of a 400 pound bag of sand 28-32 inches in diameter 
          dropped into the net from the highest surface at which employees are 
          exposed to fall hazards, but not from less than than 42 inches above 
          that level.</li>
        <li>When the 
          employer can demonstrate that it is unreasonable to perform the drop-test 
          described above, the employer or a designated competent person 
          shall certify that the net and net installation have sufficient 
          clearance and impact absorption by preparing a certification record 
          prior to the net being used as a fall protection system. The 
          certification must include:  
          <ul>
            <li>Identification 
              of the net and net installation.</li>
            <li>Date 
              that it was determined that the net and net installation were in 
              compliance.</li>
            <li>Signature 
              of the person making the determination and certification.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The most 
          recent certification record for each net and net installation must be available at the jobsite for inspection.</li>
        <li>Safety 
          nets must be inspected for wear, damage, and other deterioration 
          at least once a week, and after any occurrence which could affect the 
          integrity of the system.</li>
        <li>Defective 
          nets shall not be used, and defective components must be removed 
          from service.</li>
        <li>Objects 
          which have fallen into the safety net, such as scrap pieces, 
          equipment, and tools, must be removed as soon as possible from the net 
          and at least before the next work shift.</li>
        <li>Maximum mesh size must not exceed 6 inches by 6 inches. All mesh crossings must be<br>
          secured to prevent enlargement of the mesh opening, which must be no longer<br>
          than 6 inches, measured center-to-center.</li>
        <li>Each safety 
          net, or section thereof, must have a border rope for webbing 
          with a minimum breaking strength of 5,000 pounds.</li>
        <li>Connections 
          between safety net panels must be as strong as integral net 
          components, and must not be spaced more than 6 inches apart.</li>
