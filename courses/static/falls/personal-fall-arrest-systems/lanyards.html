                <p>A lanyard is a flexible rope, wire rope, or strap which generally has a connector at each end for
                    connecting
                    the body belt or body harness to a deceleration device, lifeline, or
                    anchorage point.
                    Some manufacturers offer adjustable length lanyards.
                    Effective lanyards are maintained in a clean, intact condition, and inspected prior to each use for
                    wear,
                    tear, and any obvious distortion or signs that the fall arrest (energy-absorbing)
                    system has been activated </p>

                <p>

                    Inspecting a lanyard involves beginning at one end and continuing to the opposite end.
                    During an inspection, the lanyard is slowly rotated so that its entire circumference is checked.
                    Spliced ends require particular attention.

                <p>Lanyards used for personal fall protection are not to be used for hoisting materials. Equipment used

                    <strong>Deceleration Device</strong>
                </p>

                <p>
                    A deceleration device is a mechanism (e.g., tearing or deforming lanyards) that serves to dissipate
                    energy during a fall to limit the energy and stress imposed on a worker during a fall. Deceleration
                    occurs over a maximum distance of 3.5 feet (see 29 CFR 1926.502(d)(16)(iv)). Deceleration devices
                    vary widely. Examples include:
                </p>

                        <p>
                            <strong> Self-retracting lanyard.</strong> A self-retracting lanyard/lifeline contains a
                            drum-wound line which
                            can
                            be slowly extracted or retracted. The lanyard extends as necessary to allow the worker to
                            move
                            about the work area, but retracts as necessary to maintain slight tension, preventing the
                            line
                            from becoming slack. The drum is under slight tension during normal worker movement and
                            automatically locks the drum when the line is extracted too rapidly (see 29 CFR
                            1926.500(b)).
                            Self-retracting lanyards and lifelines that limit free fall to two feet or less need to
                            sustain,
                            at a minimum, 3,000 pounds applied to the device with the lanyard in the fully extended
                            position
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Self-retracting lanyards that do not limit free fall to two feet or less need to sustain, at
                            a minimum, 5,000 pounds applied to the device with the lanyard in the fully extended
                            position
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Some retractable lifelines provide a deceleration (energy-absorbing) function. These
                            lifelines can include a feature that slows the fall over a distance of up to 3.5 feet

                        <strong>Rip-stitch lanyards. </strong>

                        A rip-stitch lanyard has extra webbing incorporated into the lanyard. The extra webbing is
                        stitched into place and folded lengthwise along the lanyard. During a fall, the weaker stitching
                        allows the folded webbing to pull away at a controlled speed, slowing the fall.

                        <strong> Shock-absorbing lanyards. </strong>

                        The webbing in a shock-absorbing lanyard is designed to stretch as it receives the worker's
                        falling weight. The stretching action breaks the fall in a controlled manner.

                        This is not an all-inclusive list of lanyards. OSHA expects that emerging lanyard technology
                        will continue to improve safety in the workplace.
