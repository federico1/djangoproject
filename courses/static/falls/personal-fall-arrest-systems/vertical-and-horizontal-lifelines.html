                    A lifeline is a component consisting of a flexible line for connection to an anchorage at one end to
                    hang vertically (vertical lifeline) or for connection to anchorages at both ends to stretch
                    horizontally (horizontal lifeline), and which serves as a means for connecting other components of a
                    PFAS to the anchorage
                </p>

                <p>
                    Vertical lifelines remain connected to a set anchorage point while the lanyard moves with the
                    worker. If the worker falls, the clip locks (cable grab) to the lifeline and stops the worker
                    from
                    falling further. When vertical lifelines are used each worker generally needs to be attached to
                    a
                    separate lifeline
                </p>

                <p>
                    Horizontal lifelines require special attention during design and installation to: (1) limit the
                    distance the worker can fall (a greater sag in the line can mean a farther fall); and (2)
                    minimize
                    the forces on the connectors at the anchorage (a greater sag in the line can mean lower forces
                    on
                    the anchorage connectors at either end). A qualified person must supervise the horizontal
                    lifeline’s
                    design, installation, and use
                </p>

                <p>
                    Depending on their geometry and sag angle, horizontal lifelines may be subjected to greater
                    loads
                    than the impact load imposed by an attached component. When the horizontal lifeline’s sag is
                    less
                    than 30 degrees, the impact force imparted to the lifeline by an attached lanyard is greatly
                    amplified. For reference, a 15-degree sag angle amplifies the force approximately 2:1. A 5
                    degree
                    sag angle amplifies the force approximately 6:1
                </p>

                <p>
                    When a horizontal lifeline is used for multiple tie-offs, if one worker falls, the lifeline's
                    movement may cause other workers to fall.
                </p>

                <p>
                    OSHA is aware of emerging fall protection technology, such as pre-manufactured horizontal
                    lifelines,
                    that will continue to improve workplace safety.

                    <p>Lifelines function as an extension of an anchorage system, allowing an employee to move up and down
                        (vertical lifeline) or back and forth (horizontal lifeline) across a work area. A sliding fitting
                        (rope grab or shuttle) connects to the line and a lanyard connects the worker’s harness to that
                        sliding fitting.</p>
                    <p>Vertical lifelines require active participation by the worker, who must often reposition the rope
                        grab when moving to a new position. </p>
