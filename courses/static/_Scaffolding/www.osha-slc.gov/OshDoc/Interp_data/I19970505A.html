May 5, 1997</p>
<p>
Mr. Tom Anderson<br>
Lincoln Electric Systems<br>
2620 Fairfield Street<br>
Lincoln, NE 68521-1307</p>
<p>
Dear Mr. Anderson:</p>
<p>
This is in response to your May 1, 1997 letter addressed to Mr.Glenn Taylor 
in the Kansas Regional Office of the U.S. Department of Labor, Occupational 
Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).  Your letter was forwarded to this 
office for response.  Please accept our apology for the delay in responding.  
In your letter you requested clarification on what OSHA regulations apply to 
dual purpose mechanical equipment used as a digger derrick and also as an 
aerial lift device.  Your questions and our replies follow:</p>
<p>
Question 1:</p>
<p class="BLOCK1">
The dual purpose mechanical equipment meets American National Standards 
Institute standard ANSI Al0.31-1995 on digger derricks.  Does the dual 
purpose mechanical equipment have to meet ANSI A92.2-1990 when used as an 
aerial lift?</p>

Reply:
<p class="BLOCK1">
Sections 1910.67 and 1926.453 apply to this dual purpose mechanical 
equipment when used as an aerial lift.  Under &#167;1910.67 and 
&#167;1926.453, an aerial lift must meet the applicable requirements in ANSI 
A92.2-1969.</p>

<p class="BLOCK1">It is OSHA's policy to encourage an employer to use a current national 
consensus standard in place of an earlier revision cited in OSHA regulations 
as long as the current revision provides at least a level of safety and 
health that would be provided by meeting the applicable OSHA standard.  This 
use would be considered a"de minimis violation. [De minimis violations are 
violations of existing OSHA standards which have no direct or immediate 
relationship to safety or health.  Such violations of the OSHA standards 
result in no citations, no penalty and no required abatement.]</p>
<p>
Question 2:</p>
<p class="BLOCK1">
If the provisions of &#167;1910.67 are met, can the aerial lift of this dual 
purpose mechanical equipment be used as an elevated platform to perform work 
on energized transmission power lines, that is, glove 7200 volts in a 12470 
"y" system and be in compliance with OSHA requirements?</p>
<p>
Reply:</p>
<p class="BLOCK1">
No. When employees work on or  near exposed electric power transmission and 
distribution conductors and equipment, 29 CFR 1910.269 which includes 
mechanical equipment requirements in paragraph 1910.269(p) applies.</p>
<p>
We appreciate your interest in employee safety and health.  If we can be of 
further assistance, please contact the Office of Safety Compliance 
Assistance, Mr. Ronald J. Davies, telephone (202) 219-8031, extension 110.</p>
<p>
Sincerely,</p>
<p>
John B. Miles, Jr., Director<br>
Directorate of Compliance Programs</p>
