<p>
<b>Safety Standards for Scaffolds Used in the Construction Industry</b>
<p>
<b>AGENCY:</b> Occupational Safety and Health Administration, U.S.
Department of Labor.
<p>
<b>ACTION:</b> Final rule.
_______________________________________________________________________
<p>
<b>SUMMARY:</b> The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)
hereby revises the construction industry safety standards which regulate the
design, construction, and use of scaffolds. The final rule updates the
existing scaffold standards and sets performance-oriented criteria, where
possible, to protect employees from scaffold-related hazards such as falls,
falling objects, structural instability, electrocution and overloading.
<p>
In particular, the final rule has been updated to address types of scaffolds
-- such as catenary scaffolds, step and trestle ladder scaffolds, and
multi-level suspended scaffolds -- not covered by OSHA's existing scaffold
standards. In addition, the final rule allows employers greater flexibility
in the use of fall protection systems to protect employees working on
scaffolds and extends fall protection to erectors and dismantlers of
scaffolds to the extent feasible. Another area that the final rule
strengthens is training for workers using scaffolds; the conditions under
which such employees must be retrained are also specified in the final rule.
Finally, the language of the rule has been simplified, duplicative and
outdated provisions have been eliminated, overlapping requirements have been
consolidated, and the performance orientation of the rule has been enhanced
to allow employers as much flexibility in compliance as is consistent with
employee protection.
<p>
<b>DATES:</b> Effective dates. This standard will become effective on
November 29, 1996, except for 1926.453(a)(2), which will not become effective
until an Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Control number is received and
displayed for this "collection of information" in accordance with the
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). OSHA will publish a
document in the Federal Register announcing the effective date of
1926.453(a)(2).
<p>
Incorporation by reference. The incorporations by reference of certain
publications listed in this final rule are approved by the Director of the
Federal Register as of November 29, 1996.
<p>
Compliance date: Employers are required to comply with the provisions of
paragraphs (e)(9) and (g)(2) of 1926.451, which address safe access and fall
protection, respectively, for employees erecting and dismantling supported
scaffolds starting on September 2, 1997.
<p>
Comments.  Written comments on the paperwork requirements of this final rule
must be submitted on or before October 29, 1996.
<p>
<b>ADDRESSES:</b> In compliance with 28 U.S.C. 2112(a), the Agency
designates for receipt of petitions for review of the standard, the Associate
Solicitor for Occupational Safety and Health, Office of the Solicitor, Room
S-4004, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington,
D.C. 20210.
<p>
Suggestions and information regarding the drafting of non-mandatory Appendix
B, "Criteria for Determining the Feasibility of Providing Fall Protection and
Safe Access for Workers Erecting or Dismantling Supported Scaffolds" should
be submitted to the Docket Officer, Docket S-205, U.S. Department of Labor,
Room N-2625, 200 Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, D.C. 20210.
