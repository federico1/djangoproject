IV. Economic Assessment and Regulatory Flexibility Analysis
<p>
Introduction
<p>
Executive Order (EO) 12866 requires regulatory agencies to conduct an
economic analysis for rules that meet certain criteria. The most frequently
used criterion under EO 12866 is that the rule will impose annual costs on
the economy of $100 million or more. OSHA's final standard for scaffolds in
construction does not meet this criterion, or any of the other criteria
specified by EO 12866, and therefore does not require an economic analysis.
Nevertheless, OSHA has decided to conduct such an analysis to provide the
regulated community with as much information about the rule as possible. The
Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, as amended in 1996, requires OSHA to
determine whether the Agency's regulatory actions will have a significant
impact on a substantial number of small entities. Making this determination
requires OSHA to perform a screening analysis to identify any such impacts.
Consistent with these requirements, OSHA has prepared this economic analysis
and regulatory flexibility screening analysis of the final rule for scaffolds
in construction. The final rule being published today will replace the
outdated consensus standard addressing scaffolds in construction that was
adopted by OSHA in 1971 and has remained largely unchanged since then.
<p>
This analysis includes a description of the industries affected by the
regulation, an evaluation of the risks addressed, an assessment of the
benefits attributable to the final standard, a determination of the
technological feasibility of the new requirements, an estimate of the costs
of compliance with the standard, a determination of the economic feasibility
of compliance with the standard, and an analysis of the economic and other
impacts associated with this rulemaking, including those on small businesses.
The following is a summary of this analysis, which is available from OSHA's
docket office.
<p>
The Final Standard for Scaffolds in Construction
<p>
This final standard for scaffolds in the construction industry makes many
changes to the consensus standard adopted by OSHA in 1971 and codified at 29
CFR 1926.450 to 1926.453 (Subpart L of OSHA's construction industry
standards). Appendix A of the Final Economic Analysis compares, on a
provision-by-provision basis, the final standard with the standard that has
been on the books since 1971. In this economic analysis, the standard being
published today is referred to as the final standard, while the standard it
replaces is termed the "existing" standard.
<p>
One of the important distinctions between the two standards is the clarity
and simplicity of the final standard, which is written in language that
people in the construction industry use to describe scaffolds and their
components. Technical terms required to convey information accurately and
unambiguously are defined clearly in paragraph (b) of final rule 1926.450.
The final rule also updates the regulatory text to reflect changes in
technology that have occurred in the quarter century since the existing
standard was written. These changes will permit scaffold manufacturers and
users to benefit from technological change and give them additional
flexibility in using up-to-date equipment. The final standard also clarifies
and resolves issues of terminology or areas of confusion that have been
identified by scaffold users over the years. In the past, OSHA has addressed
implementation problems of this sort in letters of interpretation or
compliance memoranda or directives; the final standard corrects and revises
the provisions that gave rise to these interpretations. Finally, the final
standard adds protection for employees using scaffolds. The principal areas
in the new standard that have been strengthened are employee training,
protection from electrical hazards, and procedures for employees engaged in
the erection and dismantling of scaffolds. These requirements reflect OSHA's
long experience in accident investigation in the construction industry, as
well as an extensive analysis of the leading causes of scaffold-related
fatalities and injuries.
<p>
Affected Industries
<p>
The requirements of the final standard apply to all establishments in the
construction industry. As classified by the 1987 Standard Industrial
Classification (SIC) manual, the industry can be divided into three broad
types of activities: building construction general contractors (SIC 15),
heavy construction general and special trade contractors (SIC 16), and
construction by other special trade contractors (SIC 17).
<p>
There are 572,850 establishments in the construction sector employing
approximately 4.7 million employees. Small establishments with one to nine
employees, which represent 82 percent (or 469,349) of establishments,
collectively employ only 1.4 million employees (30 percent). The number of
construction workers is estimated to be approximately 3.6 million. OSHA
estimates that there are approximately 2.34 million construction workers (65
percent of all construction workers) who frequently work on scaffolds and who
would be affected by the final standard for scaffolds.
<p>
Evaluation of Risk and Potential Benefits
<p>
Of the 510,500 injuries and illnesses reportedly occurring in the
construction industry annually, an estimated 9,750 are related to scaffolds.
Similarly, of the estimated 924 occupational fatalities occurring annually
among construction employees, at least 79 fatalities are associated with work
on scaffolds. OSHA estimates that the new requirements in the final rule will
prevent 47 of these fatalities and 4,455 of these injuries annually; these
numbers are above and beyond the fatalities and injuries that would be
prevented if construction employers complied with OSHA's existing scaffold
standard. OSHA estimates that the total value of the cost savings associated
with this revised standard is $90 million per year. This estimate of cost
savings considers only those scaffold related injuries that involve lost
workdays.
<p>
Costs and Technological Feasibility
<p>
The total estimated costs associated with the final standard amount to about
$12.62 million annually. The largest single cost ($5.85 million) is
associated with inspections of non-suspended scaffolds before use. The
remaining costs are attributable to requirements for additional training for
employees exposed to potential hazards involving work on scaffolds ($5.30
million) and for fall protection for employees erecting and dismantling
scaffolds(1) ($1.47 million). Table ES-1 shows the annual costs of compliance
associated with the final rule.

<ul>(1) This requirement has a one year delayed implementation date.
Because the requirements of the final standard can be met with existing
equipment and methods, the standard is technologically feasible.</ul>
<p>
Economic Impacts
<p>
Compliance with the requirements of the final standard has been determined
to be economically feasible and is not expected to produce significant
adverse economic impacts on firms in the construction industry. The estimated
compliance costs represent less than 0.002 percent of construction revenues.
Given the minimal price increase necessary to cover the costs of the final
standard, employers should be able to pass these compliance costs on their
customers. However, even if all costs were absorbed by the affected firms (a
highly unlikely scenario), the average reduction in profits would be only
0.04 percent.
<p>
Regulatory Flexibility Screening Analysis
<p>
Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 as amended (5 U.S.C. 601
et seq.), OSHA has assessed the small-business impact of the final standard
for scaffolds used in construction, and has certified based on that
assessment and the underlying data, that the standard will not have a
significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. The controlling
consideration for a regulatory flexibility analysis is whether the standard
would impose significant economic impacts on a substantial number of small
entities. The significance of any economic impact is measured by the effect
on profits, market share, and an entity's financial viability.
<p>
The small establishment size standards established by the U.S. Small
Business Administration (SBA) for the construction industry, which are based
on establishment receipts, are $17 million for establishments in SICs 15 and
16, and $7 million for establishments in SIC 17. Of the 572,850
establishments affected by the revised standard, 493,637(1) establishments,
or about 86 percent of all construction establishments, are considered small
establishments as defined by the SBA.
<PRE>
__________
 Footnote(1) 144,671 establishments in SIC 15, 28,206 establishments in
SIC 16 and 320,637 establishments in SIC 17.

</PRE>
<p>
OSHA assessed the potential economic impacts of the rule on all affected
establishments and has concluded that the rule is economically feasible and
will not impose a substantial burden on construction employers. As indicated
above, firms would only have to increase the price charged for their services
by, at most, 0.002 percent of the value of their sales in order to recover
the money they expended on compliance. In the unlikely event that firms could
not pass any of these costs to their customers and had to absorb all of the
costs themselves (a highly unlikely scenario), the average reduction in
profits caused by these costs would be only 0.04 percent. On average, the
value of receipts for establishments in the construction industry is
estimated to be $1.12 million. Firms with sales in this range clearly fall
within the SBA size standard.
<p>
To ensure that even the smallest firms in this industry would not be
significantly impacted by the costs of compliance associated with the final
standard, OSHA also examined the financial profile for small construction
establishments with 9 or fewer employees at the four-digit SIC code level,
which constitutes the overwhelming majority of firms in this industry. To
examine the impact of the standard on the smallest and potentially most
affected firms, OSHA made a series of extreme-case assumptions: that all
employees in these establishments use scaffolds in the course of their work
and that these establishments have not implemented any of the new work
practices or procedures required by the final rule. In addition, OSHA assumed
that two employees at each firm would require fall protection systems and
training in the erection and dismantling of supported-scaffolds. Assuming a
baseline turnover rate of 15 percent, and using the formulas presented in
Chapter V of the Economic Analysis, such a small establishment, which
represents an extreme-case impact situation, would incur compliance costs of
$603(2) annually.
<PRE>
__________
 Footnote(2) Annual 15 minute-training for workers who use scaffolds =
$11, annual training cost for erectors and dismantlers = $130, annual
cost of fall protection = $106, and annual scaffold inspection cost =
$356.

</PRE>
<p>
Table ES-2 presents the results of this extreme-case analysis. It shows
estimated compliance costs and economic impacts relative to revenues and
pre-tax income for small businesses by four-digit SIC code level. OSHA
compared the baseline financial data for these firms with OSHA's estimate of
the standard's annual compliance cost by computing compliance costs as a
percentage of revenue. This approach (Table ES-2) reflects extreme case
impacts because it assumes that employers have to recover the costs of
achieving compliance by increasing their prices. Under this full cost
pass-through scenario, the maximum average expected price increase required
to recover the full costs of compliance with this standard would be extremely
small, approximately 0.1 percent. The four-digit industry estimated to
experience the highest potential price increase would be Painting and Paper
Hanging (SIC 1721), where firms could have to increase prices by 0.18
percent. Again, since these impacts are based on extreme-case costs, they are
likely to be overestimating.
<p>
Under the second scenario used to test the impacts of actions on markets --
the no cost pass-through scenario -- firms are assumed not to be able to pass
any of their costs through to their customers in the form of price increases.
If no costs can be passed on, firms would have to absorb these costs entirely
from their profits (a highly unlikely scenario). Using this assumption, the
average expected decline in profits for these very small firms would be only
1.44 percent. The largest potential impact of the standard would be
anticipated in the Plastering, Drywall and Acoustical industry (SIC 1742),
where firms could experience a decline in profits of 2.71 percent. Such
impacts are not large enough to be significant because they mean, for
example, that the profit rate for such a company would decline only from 5.0
percent to 4.9(3) percent. As noted, these figures are based on highly
conservative assumptions and are therefore likely to overestimate standard's
impact.
<PRE>
__________
 Footnote(3) $22,265/$445,303 = 5.0%, $22,265 x (100 - 2.71%)
/$445,303 = 4.9%.

</PRE>
<p>
Because fixed costs, such as those for preparing training materials, are
larger as a percentage of revenues the smaller the firm, the smallest firms
will experience the greatest economic impacts. If the smallest firms, with
extreme-case costs, will experience no significant impact, it is reasonable
to conclude that larger firms will not experience significant economic
impacts. Thus, because this standard will not have a significant impact
either on the smallest establishments (those with 9 or fewer employees) or on
the typical establishment in this industry, OSHA certifies that this final
standard will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities, as defined by the SBA.

Payroll, and Estimated Receipts by Industry and Firm Size, 1993.
 [b] Average revenue per establishment x mean profit rate for SIC
(derived from Dun and Bradstreet Information Services, Industry
Norms and Key Business Ratios 1994-95) x conversion formula based on
the federal corporate tax schedule.
 [c] Annual cost of compliance of 603 per establishment assumes that
all workers (5) would require training in the initial year and that
all new workers in subsequent years would require training. Two
workers will be trained in dismantling and erecting procedures.
Estimates also assume that fall protection will be required for
erectors and dismantlers and that inspections of non-suspended
scaffolds will be required.

In addition, OSHA has drafted the final standard for scaffolds in the
construction industry to achieve adequate protection for affected employees
while imposing minimal impacts on small employers. For example, the final
rule maintains the performance-oriented approach of the proposed standard,
allowing employers the flexibility to take workplace conditions into account
when framing their compliance strategies. In addition, OSHA considered and
adopted several alternatives designed to minimize small business impacts. For
example, revisions reflected in the final standard's requirements for fall
protection (grandfathering existing guardrail systems and allowing some use
of crossbracing in lieu of guardrails) will enable small entities to minimize
their compliance burdens. Accordingly, OSHA has determined that the final
rule effectively addresses small employer concerns.
