Electrocuted</b></font> </h1><hr>
  
<p><b>Case Reports from OSHA files</b> </p>

<ul>
  <li>The victim was dismantling a tubular,
welded-frame scaffold. Another employee, on the same level of the scaffold, was
lowering planks to the next level while the victim was tying the scaffold frames
to a pulley and lowering them to the ground. One of the frames became entangled
with part of the scaffold structure. As he attempted to free the stuck scaffold
frame, the victim fell approximately 24 feet to the ground, sustaining multiple
skull fractures, brain contusions, and other internal injuries. He was taken to
a hospital and pronounced dead on arrival. The scaffold frame that he was
lowering came in contact with a 4,000-volt electric feeder line and caused an
electric arc. It is not known if the explosion startled the victim and caused him
to fall, or if he lost his balance before the explosion occurred.</li></ul><ul>
  <li>A painter and a carpenter were painting
church windows from a tubular, welded-frame scaffold approximately 25 feet high
and mounted on rubber casters. After the workers had completed one side of the
church, they attempted to move the scaffold to another location to continue
painting. They passed the scaffold under a 12,000-volt power line that was
approximately 30 feet above ground level. They then changed direction and tried
to pass the scaffold under the same power line at a point where it was only 24
feet above ground level. The scaffold contacted one phase of the power line,
providing a path to the ground for the electric current. The two workers
grasping the scaffold were electrocuted.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Employees of a masonry company were
erecting a brick wall from a tubular, welded-frame scaffold. The scaffold had
been constructed approximately 21 inches across from a 7,620-volt power line. A
laborer carried a 10' long x 8&quot; wide piece of wire reinforcement along the
top of the scaffold and contacted the power line with it. The laborer, who was
wearing gloves, received an electric shock and dropped the wire reinforcement,
which fell across the power line and simultaneously contacted the metal rail of
the scaffold. A 20-year old bricklayer standing on the work platform in contact
with the main scaffold was electrocuted.&nbsp;</li>
