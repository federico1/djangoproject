After the sign had been partially painted, the scaffold was moved to allow concrete to be placed around the sign. Several days later, a crew of seven workers was instructed to replace the scaffold and finish painting the sign. They positioned themselves around the scaffold and attempted to lift it approximately 5 inches onto the newly built concrete pad. As they were lifting the scaffold, the top section partially separated from the adjoining section, toppled over, and contacted a power line. A 28-year old carpenter and a 31-year old laborer were electrocuted. The other five workers were hospitalized with electrical burns.</li>
