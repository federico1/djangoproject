                <p>Fabricated frame scaffolds are the most common type of scaffold because they are versatile, economical, and easy to use. They are frequently used in one or two tiers by residential contractors, painters, etc., but their modular frames can also be stacked several stories high for use on large-scale construction jobs. <em>NOTE</em>: Except where indicated, the same basic scaffold requirements that appear in this module also apply to manually propelled, pump jack, ladder jack, tube and coupler, and pole scaffolds, as well as the specialty scaffolds described in Supported Scaffolds. Additional requirements for these scaffolds can be found in their respective modules.</p>
                <p>Use this training tool to review the safety requirements for a frame scaffold, in the following phases:</p>

                        <p>Workers are most vulnerable to fall hazards when climbing on or off a scaffold. Therefore, employers are required to provide safe scaffold access. Erectors and dismantlers face additional access problems due to the incomplete condition of the scaffolding. Requirements to prevent falls that apply only to these workers are addressed separately below.</p>
                        <p><em>NOTE</em>: Except where indicated, these requirements also apply to manually propelled, pump jack, ladder jack, tube and coupler, and pole scaffolds, as well as the specialty scaffolds described in the Supported Scaffolds module.</p>

The scaffold was constructed on a poured concrete floor and had been leveled. Each section of the framework measured 6'5" high. The working surface was solidly planked. When the employee tried to set the third level frame into the pins of the second level, the frame he was trying to position   flipped to one side. The momentum of the frame thrust the employee backward off the second level. He fell to the ground, sustaining a fatal blow to his head.</li>
