                    <p>Mast climbing supported scaffolds (mast climbers) carry much heavier loads than traditional scaffolding and are used to position personnel and the necessary tools, equipment, and materials needed to perform work at great heights.</p>
                    <p>Mast climbers can be free-standing or tied to a structure at intervals for stability at increased heights.  The mast may be supported on a stationary base, or for some projects that are lower, on a mobile base. Because mast climbers may be easily adjusted to optimize of working heights, they can reduce the potential for shoulder and lower back injuries to workers. Proper platform positioning reduces material handling hazards and fatigue and improves productivity. Since guardrail systems are built-in, fall protection travels with the platforms. Their small base footprint makes mast climbers very useful on projects with limited space. Mast climbers may be easily customized, and their flexibility gives many trades multiple options for performing work efficiently, in safe and ergonomically correct work conditions.</p>

                                                    Mast climbers are a popular choice for masonry work because of their ability to lift heavy loads of workers, tools, and materials. They can transport a large supply of mortar, brick, block, masons and helpers to elevation. The machines hold at a precise elevation as the masons work and move properly following each course. However, failing to follow load charts can disastrously overload a mast climber platform, its mast, tie-in braces, and its base or base support level. Overloading mast climbers has been found to have caused structural failures, injuries and deaths./p&gt;
