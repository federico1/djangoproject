                    Two-point adjustable suspension scaffolds, also known as swing-stage scaffolds, are perhaps the most common type of suspended scaffold. Hung by ropes or cables connected to stirrups at each end of the platform, they are typically used by window washers on skyscrapers,
                    but play a prominent role in high-rise construction as well.

                                            <p>A three-man crew was using an improvised suspension scaffold to paint the interior of a 68-foot-tall, 32-foot-diameter water tank. The scaffold consisted of an aluminum ladder used as a platform, and secured to steel "stirrups" made of steel bar stock bent into a box shape and attached to each end of the ladder. Wire cables from each stirrup ran to a common tie-off point. A cable from this common tie-off was rigged to a block-and-tackle used from ground level to raise and lower the platform. The block-and-tackle supporting the system was secured to a vertical steel pipe on top of the tank by a cable, which was fashioned into a loop by U-bolting the dead ends of a piece of wire rope.</p>
                                            <p>The victim had been painting from one end of this scaffold while wearing a safety belt and lanyard attached to an independent lifeline. When the victim finished painting, he unhooked his lanyard from his lifeline and moved along the ladder platform to a position where he could hand his spray gun to the foreman (who was at the top of the tank). As the foreman took the spray gun, he heard a "pop" and saw the scaffold and the victim fall 65 feet to the floor of the tank.</p>
                                            <p>Investigation of the incident revealed that the two U-bolts on the loop of cable supporting the block-and-tackle had loosened enough to allow the cable ends to slip through, causing the scaffold to fall. This particular rig had been used without incident every day for two week preceding this fatal fall.</p>

The preferred industry practice at the beginning of a shift is to raise the scaffold 3 feet, hit the brakes, then lower the scaffold and hit the brakes again. This ensures that moisture on the wire rope will not allow it to slip through the braking mechanism, causing the scaffold to fall (see <!-- BEGIN LINK TO ACCORDION using function toAccordion(); --><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="toAccordion('#Access_General')" title="Access">Access</a>).</p>

                                    <h5>Failed Scaffold Hoists Cause Worker Deaths</h5>
                                    <p><strong>Case Reports:</strong></p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>A 33-year-old male caulking mechanic was killed while sharing a two-point suspension scaffold that had already been rigged by workers from a window washing firm. Although he had brought safety belts and lifelines to the site, this equipment had been left in the company truck. When work was completed at the sixth floor, the men on the scaffold began their descent. Suddenly, the victim's end of the scaffold dropped to a vertical position, and the victim fell from the scaffold to the ground 60 feet below. The second man on the scaffold (the window washer) managed to cling to the scaffold and a nearby window ledge until he could be rescued. Inspection of the scaffold hoist revealed a defect in a centrifugal safety brake. This defect and the victim's possible failure to release the parking brake before beginning his descent caused one end of the scaffold to drop.</li>
                                        <li>Three workers were on a two-point suspension scaffold rated at 500 lbs. working weight. As the employees went up in the scaffold, the right side fell to the ground from an elevation of 20 feet. One worker managed to hold on, the other two fell with the scaffold, resulting in one worker dying and the other being hospitalized for extensive injuries. Investigation indicated that the scaffold motor assembly was improperly connected to the scaffold platform. The workers were wearing the available safety harnesses and lifelines but had not connected the lifelines.</li>
                                        <li>Two employees, the leadman and a trainee mechanic, were assigned to move a two-point suspended scaffold equipped with two SC40 hoists. They lowered the scaffold from the top roof some 16 feet to a small intermediate roof. The plan was to lower the scaffold an additional 20 feet to the main roof. After approximately two feet, the right-side hoist unit stopped. The employees thought that the overspeed brake had accidentally set. The leadman--the competent person on site--got out of the scaffold onto the roof and worked with the trainee to manually override and release the overspeed brake. This was done without inspecting the hoist for sufficient cable length. The right side hoist had only been set up with enough cable to go from the upper roof to the intermediate roof, a total of 16 feet (the total cable length measured 18 feet 5½ inches). When the brake was released, the three inches of cable left on the drum ran out and the hoist fell, causing the right side of the scaffold to drop. The trainee fell 18 feet, landed on a stored scaffold pick, and was lucky to sustain only a chipped ankle bone and a bruised calf. The company did not conduct a fall protection or competent person inspection, nor was a safety line or any fall protection used. The hoist worked as designed, but the wire rope safety device was manually overridden.</li>

As the employees went up in the scaffold, the right side fell to the ground from an elevation of 20 feet. One worker managed to hold on, the other two fell with the scaffold, resulting in one worker dying and the other being hospitalized for extensive injuries. Investigation indicated that the scaffold motor assembly was improperly connected to the scaffold platform. The workers were wearing the available safety harnesses and lifelines but had not connected the lifelines.</li>
                                <li>Two employees, the leadman and a trainee mechanic, were assigned to move a two-point suspended scaffold equipped with two SC40 hoists. They lowered the scaffold from the top roof some 16 feet to a small intermediate roof. The plan was to lower the scaffold an additional 20 feet to the main roof. After approximately two feet, the right-side hoist unit stopped. The employees thought that the overspeed brake had accidentally set. The leadman--the competent person on site--got out of the scaffold onto the roof and worked with the trainee to manually override and release the overspeed brake. This was done without inspecting the hoist for sufficient cable length. The right side hoist had only been set up with enough cable to go from the upper roof to the intermediate roof, a total of 16 feet (the total cable length measured 18 feet 5½ inches). When the brake was released, the three inches of cable left on the drum ran out and the hoist fell, causing the right side of the scaffold to drop. The trainee fell 18 feet, landed on a stored scaffold pick, and was lucky to sustain only a chipped ankle bone and a bruised calf. The company did not conduct a fall protection or competent person inspection, nor was a safety line or any fall protection used. The hoist worked as designed, but the wire rope safety device was manually overridden.</li>

                <p>While a worker may technically access a suspended scaffold from a ladder, the preferred industry practice is to do so from a rooftop or from the ground, and then raise or lower the scaffold to its working location. Therefore, ladder access is not discussed in this module. To review ladder access requirements, please refer to the OSHA Standard <a href="/laws-regs/regulations/standardnumber/1926/1926.451#1926.451(e)" title="29 CFR 1926.451(e)">29 CFR 1926.451(e)</a> or the Supported Scaffolds module.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Almost all incidents that involve scaffold failure would not lead to fatality or serious injury if proper personal fall-arrest systems were in use. Hence, such incidents almost always involve two violations: One that causes the scaffold to fall, and the other when workers fail to use (or their employers fail to provide) appropriate safety harnesses, lanyards, lifelines, etc.</p>

                                        <li>A 27-year-old cement finisher and a co-worker were dismantling suspended scaffolding at the 160-foot level inside a 172-foot-high, circular concrete silo. Both men were wearing safety belts with nylon rope lanyards secured to independent lifelines. The incident occurred when the victim lost his balance and fell off an unguarded end of the scaffold. The co-worker stated that he saw the victim fall and jerk upward as the lanyard caught him. When the victim's weight dropped back on the lanyard, it snapped, allowing him to fall to his death on a concrete floor. Examination of the lanyard after the event showed burn damage at several places, including the point of failure. The employer did not control inspection or distribution of this fall protection equipment. Instead, the equipment was kept in a common supply bin where the workers could readily obtain it when needed and return it when work was completed. The lanyard had been returned to the storage bin even though it had probably been damaged earlier during cutting and welding operations.</li>
                                        <li>The victim and a co-worker were on a two-point suspension scaffold when the left winch lost its grip on the wire rope, causing the left side of the platform to drop. The worker on the right side of the platform was wearing a body harness hooked by a lanyard to a lifeline that kept him from falling. The victim was on the left side of the platform and was wearing the same equipment, but he apparently did not have the lanyard hooked to his lifeline. He fell eleven floors and was killed.</li>
                                        <li>A laborer was in a chimney stack on an elevated suspended scaffold approximately 350 feet high, helping bricklayers lay brick inside the liner of the chimney. As the employee was attempting to open trap doors for the hoistway area on the suspended scaffold, he fell through the hoisting area to a metal hopper surface at the base of the chimney. He was killed. The victim was not wearing fall protection while on the scaffold, or while attempting to open the hoistway doors on the scaffold. The hoistway area was not guarded.</li>

                                        <p>Platforms are to be either ladder-type, plank-type, beam-type, or light metal-type. </p>

                                            <li>A guardrail system shall be installed with openings small enough to contain the objects.</li>

                <p>Suspended scaffolds are often made of metal and sometimes used in close proximity to overhead power lines. These factors introduce the risk of electrocution. However, proper clearance and maintenance reduce this risk.</p>
                <p><em>NOTE</em>: Except where indicated, these requirements also apply to multi-level, single-point adjustable, multi-point adjustable, interior hung, needle beam, catenary, and float (ship) scaffolds.</p>

                                    <li>An insulated thimble must be used to attach each suspension wire rope to its hanging support (such as cornice hook or outrigger). Excess suspension wire rope and any additional independent lines from grounding must also be insulated. </li>
                                    <li>The suspension wire rope must be covered with insulating material at least 4 feet (1.2 m) above the hoist. </li>
                                    <li>If there is a tail line below the hoist, it must be insulated to prevent contact with the platform. The portion of the tail line that hangs free below the scaffold must be guided or retained, or both, so that it does not become grounded. </li>
                                    <li>Each hoist must be covered with insulated protective covers. </li>
                                    <li>In addition to a work lead attachment required by the welding process, a grounding conductor must connected from the scaffold to the structure (see ). The size of this conductor must be at least the size of the welding process work lead, and this conductor must not be in series with the welding process or the work piece. </li>
                                    <li>An active welding rod or uninsulated welding lead must not be allowed to contact the scaffold or its suspension system. </li>
