        <h4><strong>What Is a Scaffold?</strong></h4>
        <p>A scaffold is an elevated, temporary work platform. There are two basic types of scaffolds:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Supported scaffolds, which consist of one or more platforms supported by rigid, load- bearing members, such as poles, legs, frames, outriggers, etc.</li>
            <li>Suspended scaffolds, which are one or more platforms suspended by ropes or other non-rigid, overhead support.</li>
            <li>Other types of equipment, principally scissor lifts and aerial lifts, can be regarded as other types of supported scaffolds.</li>
        </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>Falls from elevation, due to lack of fall protection.</li>
                <li>Collapse of the scaffold, caused by instability or overloading.</li>
                <li>Being struck by falling tools, work materials, or debris.</li>
                <li>Electrocution, due to the proximity of the scaffold to overhead power lines.</li>
