  </p>

  <ul>

    <li>Employees have no indication of luggage weight and the corresponding

      hazard it presents prior to actually lifting it. The unexpected nature of

      sudden loading especially in situations such as those seen when loading

      carts from conveyors at arriving planes greatly increases the risk of

      development of low back injuries. Without some sort of visual indicator

      which alerts employees to the hazard that an individual piece of luggage

      poses, employees may attempt to handle a load while in a very weak body

      posture or handle a load with a single employee when two persons be more

      appropriate.</li>

  </ul>

      presence of yellow guard pipes around the edge of the terminal conveyor

      area forces employees to reach an additional 7 to 10 inches when

      performing lifts to and from conveyor belts. Increasing the distance that

      employees must reach by as much as 10 inches, when moving items to the

      conveyor, can increase the risk of injury by as much as 30% This problem

      appears to be of more concern when carts are being unloaded rather than

      when the carts are being loaded. During loading sessions the handle of the

      suitcase is presented toward the employee which reduces the distance which

      must be reached. After the handle is secured the bag can be then be pulled

      toward the employee for improved access prior to actually lifting the full

      load. This keeps the load in close to the torso when supporting it's full

      weight. During cart unloading the bag must be swung out, or placed, toward

      the center of the conveyor for proper final positioning. This forces the

      employee to propel the bag toward the center of the conveyor if there is a

      handle on the bag or to reach out to the middle of the conveyor to place

      the item if there is no handle. The difficulty of both of these motions is

      increased when the distance from the employee to the load is increased by

      the presence of impediments to proper access. Increasing this distance

      increases the risk of development of MSDs of the shoulder and low back.</li>

  <ul>

    <li>Manpower seems to often be inappropriately distributed to minimize

      injury due to lifting. It was observed that there were up to four

      employees at a station such as loading carts at the terminal where the

      pace was relatively slow and the resultant frequency of lifts was about 1

      lift per minute. At other stations such as unloading the cart at the plane

      or unloading the cart at the terminal where there was an increased

      urgency, there were only 2 employees which resulted in a frequency of

      lifting of about 5 to 7 lifts per minute. Since the frequency of a lifting

      task has a direct relationship on the hazard of the task, increasing the

      frequency by under staffing increases the risk of injury to the

      musculoskeletal system caused by lifting.</li>

  </div>

  <ul>

    <li>Luggage weighing in excess of 50 pounds often must be handled with the

      elbow abducted out and away from the torso. This is a very weak position

      for lifting which forces the shoulder to support most of the weight of the

      load. There are several operations where this work orientation is used.<br>

      <br>

      <ul>

        <li><img align="right" alt="Ergonomics" src="am980410fig3.gif"  width="175" height="131">The

          conveyor used at the plane does not have a sufficiently steep angle so

          suitcases can be placed on it without utilizing abducted arm

          positions. The lack of angle produces an effective loading height of

          about 32 inches which is too high when handling suitcases in the

          normal manner. Loading a suitcase which has a handle drops the ideal

          loading height down to about 18 inches since the bottom of the

          suitcase is generally at least 12 to 24 inches below the hand. To

          place the suitcase on the observed conveyor the employee must lift the

          load up to at least shoulder height using primarily shoulder force.<br>

          <br>

        </li>

        <li>Luggage often has to be positioned on the carts based on the

          destination of the flight. This sometimes requires that heavy

          suitcases are loaded onto the top shelf since the horizontal shelf

          becomes a defacto divid<img align="right" alt="Ergonomics" src="am980410fig4.gif"  width="175" height="132">er.

          This forces employees to lift the load up to or above shoulder height

          so it can be placed on the upper shelf which is located about 50

          inches above the ground.<br>

          <br>

        </li>

        <li>Lifting luggage up to the plane's storage compartments without the

          aid of a conveyor uses the same motions described in the previous two

          paragraphs and again is a stressful motion and position for the

          shoulder. Lifting a suitcase which can weigh up to 50 pounds, with the

          elbow raised nearly to shoulder height using primarily one arm places

          a severe strain on the shoulder and increases the risk of development

          of injuries such as bursitis, tendinitis, and rotator cuff injuries.<br>

  <ul>

    <li>Develop a steeper conveyor system or an add-on to the current conveyor

      such that packages which are handled with two hands, such as boxes with no

      handles, can still be laid on the conveyor at approximately the current

      height, but loads such as suitcases can be placed on the conveyor at lower

      height without the need for lifting with elevated elbow postures.</li>

  </ul>

  <ul>

    <li>Provide a vertical divider for the carts such that each cart can be

      divided into separate destination sections without using the shelf as a

      divider. Vertical dividers will provide an upper and lower shelf for

      baggage. Heavy suitcase-like items can be placed on the lower shelf while

      smaller cosmetic bags and boxes without handles can be placed on the upper

      shelf.</li>

  &nbsp;

  <ul>

    <li>Employees who must lift and place luggage while inside the plane's

      storage area must lift while in extremely awkward postures. The amount of

      torso flexion can be severe due to the low overhead clearance. Bending the

      torso moves the load away from the body which increase the stress to the

      low back. Additionally, employees must reach to place luggage into tight

      and inaccessible areas of the storage compartment. Reaching with a load in

      the hand also moves the load away from the body and increases the hazard

      of the lift. Moving loads in the weight range observed during the

      inspection under the lifting conditions which seem to be prevalent in the

      cargo holds, for prolonged periods of time increase the risk of

      development of low back injury.</li>
