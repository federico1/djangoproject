      baggage from the baggage carts onto the carousel conveyor (Figure 1)
      exposes Terminal Agents to the ergonomic hazards of repeated lifting,
      repeated torso flexions, torso twisting, and extended reaches while
      supporting a load in the hands. Employees at this station work at a very
      high rate of repetition and must reach and bend the torso because the
      carousel conveyor is at a low height of only about 12 inches. High
      frequency lifting, repeated torso flexions, reaching with a load in the
      hand, and twisting of the torso are all hazards which increase the risk of
      development of Musculoskeletal Disorders (MSDs) of the low back and
      shoulder.</li>

  <p align="left">Terminal
      employees who are unloading baggage from the baggage carts onto the
      carousel conveyor should be provided with a short roller conveyor which
      will bridge the distance between baggage cart and the conveyor. Figure 5
      shows appropriate placement of this type of device. This type of device
      could be anchored to the edge of the conveyor and allowed to slide in a
      manner similar to that used that used for library access ladders. The free
      end could then be laid onto the edge of the cart. Employees could pull the
      bag to the bridge conveyor where gravity would allow it to slide down to
      the takeaway area. Using this type of device would allow employees to lift
      loads with little torso flexion, limit long reaches while supporting a
      load, and limit lifting since most lifts could be transformed into slides.

      Service Agents must repeatedly lift and carry heavy baggage items from the
      area where customers deposit them (Figure 2) to the conveyor that takes
      them to the cart loading area (Figure 3). These bags can weigh up to or
      exceed about 70 pounds. This task involves deep torso flexions, twisting,
      and reaching with a load in the hands. Repeatedly lifting heavy items
      utilizing torso flexions and twisting and reaching with a load in the hand
      are hazards which increase the risk of development of (MSDs) of the low

    <li>
      <p align="left">All baggage should be weighed at the point where it is deposited by the
      customer and heavier pieces should be tagged for identification by the
      handling agents. Initial calculations based on the body postures observed
      during performance of several of the tasks indicate that repeated lifting
      of weights in excess of about 45 pounds would injure most of the working
      population at some time during their work experience. It would seem
      prudent to tag bags which exceed a weight of about 40 pounds as this would
      allow employees at any point in the loading or unloading process to easily
      identify bags which present a lifting hazard.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p align="left">Conveyors should be installed at the ticketing counters so Customer
      Service Agents do not need to carry heavy boxes and bags from the counter
      to the take away conveyor. This is common practice in many airports and
      greatly minimizes the amount of lifting, twisting, and torso flexions that
      Customer Service Agents must perform.</li>

      that the loading conveyor is positioned at the mid-point of the cart. This
      positioning encourages employees to plant themselves in one position while
      unloading the entire cart. Repeatedly lifting heavy items while twisting

      the baggage cart. This would allow employees to transfer baggage from one
      to the other without the need to bend at the waist and twist while placing
      the load to the lower level.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p align="left">Heavier bags which have been identified should be loaded onto the plane
      first such that the amount of lifting and maneuvering of the heaviest
      items can be minimized. None of the bags tagged as heavy should be lifted
      onto the top of stacks or lifted to the back of the cargo area.</p>

      <p align="left"><img align="right" alt="Figure 6" height="197" src="aa990126fig6.gif"  width="220">It
      appears that changing the position of the baggage cart in relation to the
      position of the aircraft loading conveyor would reduce employee torso
      twisting. The cart should be stopped such that the conveyor is close to
      the front of the cart. As can be seen in Figure 6 there is little twisting
      when employees load the conveyor from the back end of the cart. From this
      position employees lift the bag and keep it directly in front of their
      body with little twisting. They then take a step or two forward and place
      it on the conveyor. If the cart were not pulled so far forward all the
      items on the cart would be behind the conveyor and all lifts could be made
      with this technique which reduces the amount of torso twisting.</li>

  Terminal Agents loading baggage while inside the cargo compartment of
      the plane must repeatedly lift heavy items with the torso flexed forward
      and with the arms fully extended away from the body. It is very difficult
      to attain proper positioning during the loading process inside the plane
      because of the restricted space limitation within the cargo area which
      forces employees to perform almost all tasks on their knees. This forces
      employees to flex the torso forward and to perform extended reaches when
      placing items at the back of the cargo area and when placing items on top
      of the stacks which are created during the loading process. Repeatedly
      lifting heavy items utilizing torso flexions and twisting, and reaching
      with a load in the hand are hazards which increase the risk of development
      of (MSDs) of the low back and shoulder.

      <p align="left">Develop and use a rotation scheme which regularly rotates employees out
      of tasks which place a greater stress on the body. Tasks such as work
      within the cargo areas of the plane could be rotated with those which are
      less stressful such as loading baggage from the conveyor to the cart.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p align="left">The conveyor which moves baggage to the plane's cargo hold should be
      modified or the loading procedure should be adjusted such that the baggage
      is moved farther within the interior of the plane. Currently bags are
      deposited at the outside edge of the opening into the plane which forces
      employees to reach and pull to get the baggage into the interior. It
      appears that the current conveyor could be lifted slightly which would
      allow it to extend farther into the interior of the plane. If this is as
      high as the conveyor will go a small powered extension should be added to
      the end of the conveyor to increase the length and thus the ability to
      extend into the plane.

    <li>Terminal Agents who move baggage from the carousel to the carts often
      load the front of the cart first and then must reach over these items to
      place extra baggage on the back side of the cart. This type of poor
      planning forces employees to support significant loads in the hands while
      the arms are fully extended away from the body. Supporting loads in this
      manner increases the risk of development of MSDs to the shoulder and low
      back.</li>

      bags which are tagged as heavy loads. Light and small bags should be
      placed at the back of the cart so space at the front of the cart can be
      saved for those bags which present a greater hazard. All heavy loads
      should be placed on the bottom, front tier of the carts so the distance
      they are lifted can be minimized.

  <p align="center"><b>General Solutions for All Hazards Listed Above</b></p>
  <p align="left">
  It is critical that all
      employees have extensive training on the basics of body biomechanics and
      the importance of maintaining the body in an ergonomically neutral
      position while performing these tasks. This type of training will allow
      employees to perform the task in the safest possible manner and will
      facilitate their input of possible changes to the work station which may
      lessen the hazard. Generally, the torso should not be bent forward farther
      than 6 to 10 degrees from vertical, reaches should be limited to shoulder
      height vertically and 16 to 18 inches horizontally. Employees should limit
      torso twisting by moving their feet instead of twisting their backs. The
      task should be able to be performed with the elbows in close to the torso
      and the wrist should not be bent either up or down, or to either side. In
      addition to general training in the basics of biomechanics employees
      should be trained on the specifics of their particular tasks. They should
      understand the mechanics and implications of properly adjusting any work
      fixtures. They should also be aware of the early warning signs of injury
      and the proper reporting and post reporting procedures to minimize the
      chance of long term injury.
