      <p>Where 
        workers on a construction site are exposed to vertical drops of 6 feet 
        or more, OSHA requires that employers provide fall protection in one of 
        three ways <em>before</em> work begins:&nbsp; </p>
              <ul>
        <li>Placing 
          guardrails around the hazard area.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Deploying 
          safety nets.</li>
        <li>Providing 
          personal fall arrest systems for each employee.&nbsp;</li>
              </ul>
      <p>Many times 
        the nature and location of the work will dictate the form that fall protection 
        takes.&nbsp; If the employer chooses to use a guardrail system, he must 
        comply with the following provisions:
      <ul>
        <li>Top 
          edge height of top rails, or equivalent guardrail system members, 
          must be between 39 and 45 inches above the walking/working level, except 
          when conditions warrant otherwise and all other criteria are met
          (e.g., 
          when employees are using stilts, the top edge height of the top rail 
          must be increased by an amount equal the height of the stilts).</li>
        <li>Midrails, 
          screens, mesh, intermediate vertical members, or equivalent intermediate 
          structures, must be installed&nbsp; between the top edge and 
          the walking/working surface when there is no wall or other structure 
          at least 21 inches high.  
          <ul>
            <li>Midrails 
              must be midway between the top edge of the guardrail system and 
              the walking/working level.</li>
            <li>Screens 
              and mesh must extend from the top rail to the walking/working 
              level, and along the entire opening between rail supports.</li>
            <li>Intermediate 
              members (such as balasters) between posts must be no more 
              than 19 inches apart.</li>
            <li>Other 
              structural members (such as additional midrails or architectural 
              panels) must be installed so as to leave no openings wider 
              than 19 inches.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Guardrail 
          systems must be capable of withstanding at least 200 pounds 
          of force applied within 2 inches of the top edge, in any direction 
          and at any point along the edge, and without causing the top edge of 
          the guardrail to deflect downward to a height less than 39 inches above 
          the walking/working level.</li>
        <li>Midrails, 
          screens, mesh, and other intermediate members must be capable 
          of withstanding at least 150 pounds of force applied in any 
          direction at any point along the midrail or other member.</li>
        <li>Guardrail 
          systems must not have rough or jagged surfaces that 
          would cause punctures, lacerations, or snagged clothing.</li>
        <li>Top rails 
          and midrails must not cause a projection hazard by 
          overhanging the terminal posts.</li>
      </ul>
