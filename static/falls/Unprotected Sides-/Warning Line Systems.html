                    OSHA defines a warning line system as a barrier erected on a roof to warn workers that they are
                    approaching an unprotected roof side or edge, and to designate an area in which roofing
                    work may take place without the use of guardrails, body harnesses, or safety net systems to protect
                    workers in the area. Warning line systems consist of ropes, wires, or chains, plus supporting
                    stanchions. If an employer chooses to use warning line systems, the following provisions apply:

                </div>
                <ul>
                    <li> The warning line must be erected around all sides of roof work areas. 29 CFR 1926.502(f)(1).

                    </li>
                    <li> When mechanical equipment is not being used, the warning line must be erected at least 6 feet
                        from the roof edge.

                        29 CFR 1926.502(f)(1)(i).

                    </li>
                    <li> When mechanical equipment is being used the warning line must be erected:

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                At least 6 feet from the roof edge parallel to the direction of mechanical equipment
                                operation; and


                            </li>

                            <li>
                                At least 10 feet from the roof edge perpendicular to the direction of mechanical
                                equipment operation. 29 CFR 1926.502(f)(1)(ii).

                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li> The rope, wire, or chain must be flagged at not more than 6-foot intervals with high-visibility
                        material. 29 CFR 1926.502(f)(2)(i).

                    </li>
                    <li>The rope, wire, or chain must be rigged and supported so that:

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                The lowest point (including sag) is at least 34 inches from the walking or working
                                surface; and


                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Its highest point is no more than 39 inches from the walking or working surface. 29
                                CFR 1926.502(f)(2)(ii).

                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li> Stanchions, after being rigged with warning lines, must be capable of resisting, without
                        tipping over, a force of at least 16 pounds applied horizontally against the stanchion, 30
                        inches above the walking or working surface, perpendicular to the warning line and in the
                        direction of the floor, roof, or platform edge. 29 CFR 1926.502(f)(2)(iii).

                    </li>
                    <li> The rope, wire, or chain must have a minimum tensile strength of 500 pounds. After being
                        attached to the stanchions, it must support, without breaking, the loads applied to the
                        stanchions as prescribed in 29 CFR 1926.502(f)(2)(iii) & 29 CFR 1926.502(f)(2)(iv).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The rope, wire, or chain must be attached to each stanchion in such a way that pulling on one
                        section of the line between stanchions will not result in slack being taken up in the adjacent
                        section before the stanchion tips over. 29 CFR 1926.502(f)(2)(v).
                    </li>
                </ul>
