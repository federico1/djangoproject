                    A safety monitoring system is an alternative fall protection option for low-slope roofing work under
                    29 CFR 1926.501(b) (10). If employers elect to use a safety monitoring system, they must designate a
                    competent person to monitor the safety of workers and to warn them when their work puts them close
                    to a fall hazard.

                <ul class="">

                    <li> Be competent in the recognition of fall hazards. 29 CFR 1926.502(h)(1)(i); </li>

                    <li> Warn workers when it appears that they are unaware of fall hazards or when the workers are
                        acting
                        in an unsafe manner. 29 CFR 1926.502(h)(1)(ii); </li>

                    <li>Be on the same walking or working surfaces as the workers and be able to see them. 29 CFR
                        1926.502(h)(1)(iii); </li>

                    <li>Be close enough to the work operations to speak directly with workers. 29 CFR
                        1926.502(h)(1)(iv);
                        and </li>

                    <li>Have no other duties to distract them from their monitoring function. 29 CFR 1926.502(h)(1)(v).

                        Mechanical equipment is not used or stored in areas where safety monitoring systems are being
                        used to monitor workers engaged in roofing operations on low-slope roofs. 29 CFR 1926.502(h)(2);
                    </li>

                    <li>Have no other duties to distract them from their monitoring function. 29 CFR 1926.502(h)(1)(v).
                        No worker, other than one engaged in roofing work on low- slope roofs or one covered by a fall
                        protection plan, enters an area where a worker is being protected by a safety monitoring system.
                        29 CFR 1926.502(h)(3); and
                    </li>

                        All workers in a controlled access zone have been instructed to promptly comply with fall hazard
                        warnings issued by safety monitors. 29 CFR 1926.502(h)(4).

                    Safety monitoring systems must also be used as part of a fall protection plan under 29 CFR
                    1926.502(k), where no other alternative measure has been implemented. As explained in
                    more detail below, the use of a fall protection plan is limited to residential construction work,
                    precast concrete work, and leading edge work (see 29 CFR 1926.501(b)(2), (b)(12) and (b)(13)). The
                    employer must first demonstrate that it is infeasible or creates a greater hazard to use
                    conventional fall protection equipment.
