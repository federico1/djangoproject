to Improper Guardrails on Tubular Welded-frame Scaffolds</font> </b></p>
<hr width="95%">
<strong><p>Case 
  Reports</strong>
<p>The following Case 
  Reports of falls investigated by OSHA illustrate how seemingly innocent workplace 
  activities can have deadly consequences.
<ul>
  <li>An employee 
    preparing masonry facia for removal from a building fell from the third level 
    of a tubular welded-frame scaffold.&nbsp; No guarding system was provided 
    for the scaffold.&nbsp; Further, the platform was coated with ice, creating 
    a slippery condition.</li>
  <li>A contract employee 
    was taking measurements from an unguarded scaffold inside a reactor vessel 
    when he either lost his balance or stepped backwards and fell 14½ feet, sustaining 
    fatal injuries.</li>
  <li>An employee 
    was installing overhead boards from a scaffold platform consisting of two 
    2&quot; x 10&quot; boards with no guardrails.&nbsp; He lost his balance, fell 
    7½ feet to the floor, and was fatally injured.</li>
  <li>A laborer was 
    working on the third level of a tubular welded-frame scaffold which was covered 
    with ice and snow.&nbsp; Planking on the scaffold was inadequate, there was 
    no guardrail, and no access ladder for the various scaffold levels.&nbsp; 
    The worker slipped and fell head first approximately 20 feet to the pavement 
    below.</li>
</ul>
